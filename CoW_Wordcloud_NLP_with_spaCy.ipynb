    "complete_AF_text = ('Africa:African countries and regional organizations sustained ongoing counterterrorism efforts against threats in East Africa, the Sahel, and the Lake Chad region while increasing emphasis on preventing the expansion of terrorist groups, affiliates, and associated organizations into new operating areas in West Africa and Southern Africa.In East Africa, al-Shabaab retained safe haven, access to recruits and resources, and de facto control over large parts of Somalia through which it moves freely and launched external operations attacks in neighboring Kenya.  Al-Shabaab maintained its allegiance to al-Qa’ida, remaining intent on limiting the influence and reach of the northern Somalia-based group of ISIS-linked fighters responsible for local suicide bombings and other attacks against Somali security forces in greater Mogadishu.The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali security forces continued cooperation with the United States to exert pressure on al-Shabaab, primarily through coordinated counterterrorism (CT) operations and small advances in governance in southern Somalia.  The United States continued to support East African partners across the Horn of Africa in their efforts to build CT capacity, including in aviation and border security, advisory assistance for regional security forces, training and mentoring of law enforcement to manage crisis response and conduct investigations, and advancing criminal justice sector reforms.  East African partners undertook efforts to develop and expand regional cooperation mechanisms to interdict terrorist travel and other terrorism-related activities.In the Lake Chad region, ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA) – which split off from Boko Haram (BH) in 2015 – and, to a lesser extent, Boko Haram, continued to conduct attacks against civilians, government, and security forces, which resulted in deaths, injuries, abductions, and the capture and destruction of property.  Nigeria, along with its neighbors Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Benin – and at times in conjunction with the Multinational Joint Task Force – worked to counter these threats, but proved unable to stop ISIS-WA’s advance in the region or ensure adequate governance and protection for civilian populations.  The United States continued to provide advisors, intelligence, training, logistical support, and equipment to Lake Chad region countries and supported a wide range of stabilization efforts, such as defection, demobilization, disengagement, de-radicalization, and reintegration programming.  Continued attacks by BH and ISIS-WA have taken a heavy toll on the civilian population, especially in northeast Nigeria where attacks have displaced more than two million people and left roughly 10 million in need of humanitarian assistance.In the broader Sahel region, terrorist groups have expanded their operations in north and central Mali and the Tri-Border Region of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.  These include affiliates of al‑Qa’ida and ISIS, such as Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) and ISIS-Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), respectively, as well as non-aligned groups.  The number of attacks in the Western Sahel region increased 250 percent since 2018.  Partner countries remain strong willed against terrorism but lack the means to contain or degrade the threat on a sustained basis.  The G5 Sahel Joint Force (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger) was launched in 2017 to coordinate counterterrorism operations among member countries.  The G5 Sahel is not yet capable of disrupting the growing terrorist footprint across the Sahel but has potential as a coordination mechanism.  France’s Operation Barkhane, with 5,200 troops on the ground, plays a crucial role in countering terrorist groups and promoting a level of basic security, as does the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).Terrorists routinely manipulated local communal conflicts and their leaders to support terrorist operations by assisting with long-standing claims against other groups.  For example, in Nigeria, terrorists exploited the fighting between the Peuhl and Fulani ethnic groups, as well as the perennial farmer-herder violence over water and grazing areas, to recruit supporters and advance their political and operational interests.  Terrorists continued to carry out attacks on military outposts, kidnap western private citizens and humanitarian workers, attack churches, mosques and schools teaching western curricula, and assassinate civil servants and politicians.  In Mali, the government has been unable to regain control of northern and central parts of the country.  Burkina Faso also experienced increased terrorism in its northern and eastern provinces and in the southern and western parts of the country.  There was also a notable uptick in violence in the tri-border region shared by Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, which affected all three countries.Terrorist activities increased in central and southern Africa in 2019.  In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) attacked Congolese civilians, the DRC armed forces (FARDC), and UN peacekeepers.  The group reportedly killed more 300 civilians in Beni Territory as of December 13, with press reporting at least 32 additional deaths as of December 18.  The group announced plans for a significant increase in attacks on civilians in response to counter-ADF FARDC operations launched on October 30.The ISIS affiliate in Mozambique carried out numerous attacks in northern Mozambique, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 350 civilians and the internal displacement of 60,000 people.South Africa, however, saw a decrease in suspected terrorism-related incidents in 2019, following an unusually high number of incidents in 2018.  ISIS facilitation networks and cells that were first publicly acknowledged by the South African government in 2016 remained a threat.Burkina FasoOverview: Terrorist activity in Burkina Faso rapidly and significantly increased in 2019, as members of JNIM and ISIS-GS conducted the highest level of targeted political assassination, the largest attack on civilians, the largest attack on Burkinabe security forces, and the largest attack altogether on a combined population of security forces and civilians.  Individuals affiliated with terrorist organizations continue to conduct targeted assassinations, IED attacks, raids on security and military outposts, and to ignite intercommunal conflict and displace local populations in far north and east Burkina Faso.  The Burkinabe government conducted the largest CT operations in its history in its northernmost and easternmost regions and continued to increase its intelligence and investigative capacity, but terrorist activities outpaced the government’s efforts.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist attacks increased in frequency and lethality in 2019, targeting civilians and members of Burkina Faso’s security forces.  There was a 250 percent increase in terrorist attacks in Burkina Faso from 2018 to 2019.  Terrorist groups increasingly appeared to implement a deliberate strategy of hampering security forces’ movement in the northernmost region of Burkina Faso by placing IEDs on specific bridges to partially destroy them and prevent heavy vehicles from moving freely.During an August 19 attack, about 50 terrorists launched an attack on the Koutougou military outpost, killing at least 24 Burkinabe soldiers and wounding another 13 –­­­­­­­­ the largest attack ever reported against security forces.On November 3, terrorist gunmen killed the mayor of Djibo and a parliamentarian of the Sahel region, the highest-level political assassination to date.On November 6, individuals affiliated with terrorist groups conducted the largest-ever attack on a civilian population by killing at least 39 people and wounding another 60 in an attack on a convoy carrying employees, suppliers, and contractors of a Canadian mining company.ISIS claimed a December 24 attack in which assailants killed 7 security forces personnel and 35 civilians, predominantly women, in the largest attack against both civilians and security forces known to date during Burkina Faso’s fight against terrorist organizations.  Security forces reportedly killed 80 attackers while defending their base in this incident.As a result of an increasing number of attacks, Burkinabe security forces have retreated from some military and police outposts in the northernmost region of Burkina Faso.  Burkina Faso launched two major CT operations in the East and Center-North regions committing a substantial percentage of available forces in the clearing operations.Abusive counterterrorism tactics by Burkina Faso’s armed forces further exacerbated tensions between civilians and the state, and fueled recruitment of civilians into terrorist groups.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  On May 29, the National Assembly voted into law a new code of criminal procedure, which seeks to abridge criminal proceedings for terrorism cases.  The new law eliminated an additional layer of investigations by the Court of Appeal.  Instead, upon completion of the investigations, a special chamber will directly adjudicate terrorism and terrorism financing cases, shortening pre-trial timelines.  In 2019, the Burkinabe government adopted two decrees for the compensation of defense forces and public servants who are victims of terrorist attacks to galvanize public support in the fight against terrorism.  Also in 2019, the National Assembly passed a bill submitted by the government to authorize the government to recruit volunteers to defend the homeland.  While the Burkinabe government did not prosecute a terrorist in 2019, three cases were ready for trial, and the Ministry of Justice set up a committee chaired by his chief of staff to expedite the processing of pending terrorism cases.The newly created special brigade on anti-terrorism investigations (BSIAT, for Brigade Spéciale des Investigations Antiterroristes) reached operational capacity in August 2019 and closed 18 of the 31 total cases opened since then, leading to the arrest of 78 terrorist suspects.  BSIAT continues to lack a budget for fuel, phone service, and other basic logistical needs, such as food for detainees.  BSIAT has initiated dialogue with joint military and gendarme units to improve access to military information, which has resulted in the unintentional consequence of creating confusion on whose authority prevails in terrorist investigations.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Burkina Faso is a member of the Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA), a FATF-style regional body.  Burkina Faso’s FIU, the National Financial Information Processing Unit (CENTIF-BF), is a member of the Egmont Group, an informal network of FIUs aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  Burkina Faso’s FIU CENTIF in the Ministry of Economy and Finance tracks terrorist financing and concluded 18 investigations in 2019, which included cases of fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing that were referred to the Attorney General’s office for further action.Countering Violent Extremism:  Burkina Faso remains interested in countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  The government planned to inject $249 million in 2019 to support the Sahel Emergency Plan (Plan d’Urgence pour le Sahel – PUS) to strengthen the role of government, enhance community law enforcement, and generate economic opportunities in its Sahel region.  The Burkinabe government completed more than 50 percent of the plan’s overall activities by 2019.  Further recognizing the value of a holistic approach, the task force developing the Burkinabe government’s National Security Strategy has named social cohesion and coexistence, sustainable human development, and strengthening resilience to terrorism as three of the strategy’s four pillars.  With USAID support, the Ministry of Territorial Administration is considering a consultative framework and strategy to consult religious leaders on CVE issues.International and Regional Cooperation:  Burkina Faso held the rotating presidency of the G5 Sahel in 2019, and continued to work with G5 partner countries Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Chad to coordinate their regional response to terrorism and crime.  Against a backdrop of a rising terrorist threat, Burkina Faso convened an extraordinary summit on counterterrorism for members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and G5 Sahel heads of state on September 14 in Ouagadougou.  During the summit, ECOWAS member states agreed to set up a $1 billion fund from 2020 to 2024 to invest in mutual CT priorities that include border security, terrorism financing, information sharing, and intelligence coordination.  Burkina Faso maintains one peacekeeping battalion in Mali as part of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali.  Burkina Faso’s total UN contribution exceeds 1,626 personnel in support of six Peacekeeping and Special Political Missions.CameroonOverview: In 2019, Cameroon experienced a resurgence of terrorist activity in the Far North Region.  While the Government of Cameroon attributed most terrorist attacks to BH, ISIS-WA likely perpetrated a significant number of assaults.  A December 11 Amnesty International report stated that 275 people were killed by BH and ISIS-WA in 2019, nearly double the number in 2018.  Terrorists targeted civilians in villages on the western border with Nigeria and in the northern tip of the Far North Region, within the Lake Chad Basin.  They carried out ambushes, abductions, raids, beheadings, and targeted killings of vigilance committee members.  The terrorists targeted significantly more soldiers and military posts compared with 2018.In 2019, ISIS-WA transitioned from seizing resources, often extorting illegal taxes from locals, to attacking villages and security forces in the northern tip of the Far North Region.  In June, ISIS-WA perpetrated an attack on Darak Island near Lake Chad that resulted in at least 24 deaths, 16 of which were security forces.  This was the largest number of casualties from an attack since BH’s initial penetration into Cameroon in 2014.  Following at least two separate attacks, ISIS-WA fighters hoisted their black flag in localities within the region.In May 2019, the government opened the border crossing with Nigeria at Amchide, Far North Region that had been closed since 2014.  The border closing had had repercussions for trade with Nigeria and Chad.  In July, the government announced a $2.5 million project that will benefit youth in areas most affected by BH.  In August, President Paul Biya provided financial and material support to vigilance committees engaged in the fight against BH and ISIS-WA.  While some efforts were made to establish the rehabilitation and reintegration center for BH recruits in Meme, Far North Region announced by the government in 2018, the center had not yet become operational.  Significant numbers of ex-combatants abandoned BH and surrendered to security forces.Cameroon continued its CT cooperation with the international community.  Over the course of the year, Cameroon contributed to Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) operations, including providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance flights by two U.S.-donated C‑208 Cessnas.  Cameroon also remained a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and a member of the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP).  Countering terrorist threats remained a top security priority for the Government of Cameroon, which continued to work with the United States to improve the capacity of its security forces.  In 2019, the United States’ CT assistance to Cameroon included an increase in projects implemented by the Department of Justice and the Global Center for Cooperative Security.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  In a December 11 report, Amnesty International stated that in 2019, BH and ISIS-WA killed at least 275 people in attacks on the Far North Region, compared to 153 in 2018.  This represents an increase of nearly 80 percent in fatalities in 2019, compared to 2018.  L’Oeil du Sahel newspaper, which regularly tracks terrorist-related casualties in the region, estimated that between January and November, BH and ISIS-WA fighters killed at least 111 civilians and 32 security force members.  Attacks included indiscriminate killings, targeted murders, abductions, ambushes, arson, and raids in search of supplies.  A representative sample of attacks in the Far North Region include:February 8:  BH terrorists killed at least five civilians in Majirde.April 12:  Four soldiers died in Gouzda-Vreket when their vehicle passed over an IED, allegedly placed by BH.April 18:  BH terrorists killed at least 10 civilians in Tchakamari.June 10:  ISIS-WA terrorists killed at least 16 soldiers and 8 civilians in Darak, an island in Lake Chad.July 30:  BH terrorists cut off the ears of at least three women they abducted following an attack on Gakara.August 1:  BH terrorists killed at least four civilians in Gederou.September 13:  ISIS-WA terrorists killed at least six soldiers and injured nine others in Soueram.October 21:  BH terrorists killed at least four civilians and abducted several others in Goledje.October 31:  BH terrorists killed at least four civilians in Kotséhéré.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, Cameroon prosecuted numerous BH-affiliated defendants for terrorism-related crimes, primarily in the military tribunal in Maroua.  Most trials that the U.S. Embassy observed in February at the Maroua military tribunal related to individuals who were alleged to have provided logistical support to BH, as opposed to actual fighters.  The low conviction rate is due in large part to poor charging decisions by prosecutors at the outset of cases and to subsequent lack of credible evidence to support convictions at trial.  The lack of trial evidence is often the result of an absence of live witness testimony, which is not required under Cameroonian law but is increasingly expected by judges deciding cases.Cameroon continued to use the anti-terrorism law enacted in 2014 to suppress criticism and freedom of expression by arresting journalists and activists in connection with the ongoing crisis in the Anglophone regions.  In October, the government released 333 low-level detainees arrested for suspicion of being Anglophone separatists and facing misdemeanor charges.  However, hundreds of others remain in detention.  The government continued to characterize people espousing separatism for the Northwest and Southwest Regions as terrorists and, in August, sentenced separatist leader Julius Ayuk Tabe to life imprisonment.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Cameroon is a member of the Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa (GABAC), a FATF-style regional body.  Cameroon’s FIU, the National Agency for Financial Investigation, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) remains the focus in the Anglophone regions, where a significant number of former terrorists abandoned BH and surrendered to security forces.  In July, national DDR coordinator Francis Fai Yengo told former fighters at a MNJTF camp in Mora, Far North Region, that the government would finance their economic projects.In July, the government launched a “Youth and Stabilization for Peace and Security” project within the Far North Region.  This project envisions promoting tolerance and coexistence, and will finance studies, trainings, and the establishment of income-generating activities for 30,000 youths ages 12 to 25 from six of the municipalities most affected by the security crisis in the Far North Region.  The United Nations and the European Union are providing technical and financial support to this initiative, estimated at $2.5 million.Cameroon’s Council of Imams and Muslim Dignitaries organized a three-day seminar in July aimed at building the capacity of 300 imams and preachers on the ills of “religious extremism.”  The training envisioned promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence irrespective of religion and educating Muslims that BH’s extreme ideology does not represent Islamic principles.ChadOverview: In 2019, Chad experienced an estimated twofold increase in the number of terrorist attacks in the Lake Chad region from the previous year.  Though the magnitude of the average attack has lessened since 2018, BH returned to the tactics of suicide bombing and IEDs, which had not been seen in several years.  BH continued to be the most active terrorist organization in Chad, and ISIS-WA maintained a presence, predominantly in the Lake Chad area, as well.  The Government of Chad (GoC) remained a reliable partner of U.S. and other CT missions, even as financing continued to constrain operations.  Security forces and basic government services remained underfunded, which limited the GoC’s effectiveness, but Chadian armed forces still led missions throughout the region to maintain security in the Sahel.  Chad provided about 1,200 combat forces to Lake Chad Region’s Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF); however, shortly before the end of 2019, these forces redeployed to Chad.  Chad maintained a strong commitment to fight terrorists even in the most dangerous corners of the Sahel and deployed forces to Mali and Burkina Faso.  Chad continued to host the French Operation Barkhane, France’s CT mission for the Sahel.  The United States provided significant support for Chad’s Special Anti-Terrorism Group and began a multi-year training program to establish a CT Investigation Unit.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  BH and ISIS-WA continued attacks around the eastern and northern shores of Lake Chad at a pace of approximately two per week.  Many of these were small raids to plunder supplies, but terrorist groups also mounted several larger attacks of 100 or more fighters on Chadian military outposts.  The reemergence of suicide bombings by young women on civilian targets in Chad heightened tensions.  Several Chadian military units were also attacked with IEDs, including one in May that killed four Chadian soldiers and one journalist.  In October, terrorists kidnapped a doctor and two nurses, all employees of the Chadian Ministry of Health, to provide treatment to wounded terrorist fighters.  The hostages have not been recovered and the incident has spurred further deployments of Chadian security forces to the region.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The new Director General of National Police proved very supportive of U.S. CT efforts in 2019.  The National Police coordinated with the Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program to select a group of law enforcement and military officers from multiple agencies to form a new CT investigation unit and gave them a compound from which to operate.Securing borders remains a difficult task throughout the region.  Porous borders on all sides, particularly across Lake Chad, provide easy passage for terrorists and criminal entities alike.  Border security remained a shared task of the Gendarmes, Army, Customs, and the National and Nomadic Guard (GNNT), none of which is resourced sufficiently.  The Army and GNNT comprised the front line in nearly all major incidents involving BH and ISIS-WA.  At official ports of entry, both air and ground, Chad continued to be a partner in the PISCES program, which screens travelers against domestic terrorist databases.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Chad is a member of GABAC.  Chad’s FIU, the National Agency for Financial Investigation, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  In September, the executive director of the American-Islamic Congress visited Chad for a speech, which was organized through the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in response to the Chadian High Council for Islamic Affairs’ request for an American Muslim speaker.  The speaker used a variety of private, public, and media events to reinforce themes such as tolerance, inclusion, and women’s empowerment.  The High Council participated in cultural exchanges with and in the United States and stated that religious leaders’ role is to keep and promote peace as well as connectedness with others.International and Regional Cooperation:  Chad is a leader in exporting security throughout the region.  Surrounded by conflict, Chad supported CT and peacekeeping forces through numerous international organizations and provided many of the most effective military units in the most dangerous parts of central Africa.  In support of the MNJTF, 1,200 Chadians traveled to Nigeria to face BH, and Chad deployed 2,600 service members to joint border security operations as part of this task force and the G-5 Sahel.  The Chadian Army sent another 600 soldiers to conduct security operations on the border with Sudan.  Again in 2019, Chad supported the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) with 1,425 soldiers trained by the United States.  In all cases, Chadians have demonstrated the willingness and ability to engage and defeat terrorists.  As a result, Chad is highly sought after for contributions to regional missions.Chad maintains close working relationships with France, and the French Operation Barkhane launches CT missions throughout the Sahel from its base in N’Djamena.  Several other European nations increased their engagement with Chad in 2019 as well, and the GoC also sought security support from less traditional allies.  The United States remained the largest direct supporter of Chadian security forces, however, and Chad remained a reliable partner in the region in the fight against terrorism.Democratic Republic of the CongoOverview: Rebel group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) established ties with ISIS in late 2018.  Before its ISIS affiliation, the ADF previously attempted outreach to Islamist terrorist groups for multiple years, including online posts by some ADF members in 2016 and 2017 referring to their group Madinat Tauheed Wal Mujahedeen while displaying an ISIS-like flag.  ISIS publicly recognized ADF as an affiliate in late 2018 and claimed responsibility for ADF attributed attacks starting in April 2019 after an attack on an Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) base near Kamango on April 16.  The ADF has been present in Beni for years and now includes a majority of Congolese fighters, although the ADF recruits fighters from around the region as well.  In 2019, as in previous years, the ADF was responsible for numerous attacks on civilians, the FARDC, and UN peacekeepers.  During the calendar year, the Kivu Security Tracker (a joint project between the Congo Research Group and Human Rights Watch) documented 310 civilian deaths in North Kivu attributed to the ADF, as of December 13, 2019.According to the UN, there are more than 100 armed groups operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), yet, historically, the DRC and the international community have generally not referred to these armed groups as terrorists.  For political purposes, the government of former President Joseph Kabila labeled certain anti-Kabila domestic armed groups and some opposition party members as “terrorists” for challenging DRC government authority or criticizing the president.The U.S. government continues to work closely with the Government of the DRC to address potential terrorist threats.  In April, newly elected President Felix Tshisekedi visited Washington and publicly discussed the potential for ISIS expansion in North Kivu.  During the visit, the DRC formally joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  During the year, the United States offered training and exchanges in best practices with the FARDC on civil-military operations, strategic planning and messaging, and asymmetric warfare, emphasizing the importance of human rights and the law of armed conflict in CT operations.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Throughout 2019, the ADF attacked Congolese civilians, the FARDC, and MONUSCO peacekeepers located in Beni Territory, North Kivu and southern parts of Ituri in eastern DRC.  The Kivu Security Tracker reported that the ADF had killed at least 310 civilians in Beni Territory as of December 13, with press reporting at least 32 additional deaths as of December 20.  A significant increase in planned attacks on civilians was announced by ADF in response to FARDC operations against the ADF launched on October 30.Attacks have been conducted against civilians primarily by small groups of fighters, using small arms or machetes for the majority of attacks in areas where the ADF has been present for years.  There has not been a significant change in tactics or weapons used since the ADF’s public affiliation with ISIS.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The DRC has no comprehensive CT legislation.  The DRC’s National Assembly passed a draft counterterrorism bill in December 2018, which stalled in the Senate and was not finalized in 2019.  Civil society activists and others expressed concern that, if passed as written by the previous Kabila administration, the law could be used as a tool to suppress opposition parties and political dissent.  In a significant shift from the previous reporting period, national police leadership attended several international fora on combating terrorism, including Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS meetings and INTERPOL CT training.The DRC shares approximately 6,835 miles of land and lake borders with nine countries and lacks the capacity to effectively patrol its borders.  The authority responsible for monitoring frontier activity, the Director General of Migration, uses the International Organization for Migration’s Migration Information and Data Analysis System (MIDAS), a computerized personal identification and recognition system, at only a fraction of the DRC’s more than 400 official border crossings.  Since 2010, the Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has trained roughly 900 border officers from the National Police’s (PNC’s) Direction Centrale de la Police des Frontieres Congolaise (Central Border Police Directorate), which oversees security and surveillance activities at border crossings.  High turnover rates prevalent throughout the PNC resulted in few INL-trained officers remaining with border units.  The PNC anti-riot unit, the Légion Nationale d’Intervention, has a designated CT squad, which has limited staff and receives no specialized training or equipment.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The DRC is a member of GABAC.Following U.S. Treasury sanctions designations in December against Lebanon-based Nazen Said Ahmad and DRC-based Saleh Assi for supporting Specially Designated Global Terrorists, the Government of the DRC took swift action to freeze accounts belonging to sanctioned individuals and companies in the DRC owned, controlled, or directed by them.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no major changes in 2019.  DRC religious institutions including the Council of Bishops (CENCO – Episcopal), the Church of Christ in Congo (ECC – Protestant), and the Islamic community (COMICO), attended a weeklong workshop in Switzerland, led by CENCO, focused on preventing violent conflict in central Africa.International and Regional Cooperation:  The DRC is a member of the Southern African Development Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.  President Tshisekedi has raised the need for regional cooperation with these partners to combat armed groups and bring stability to the eastern DRC.DjiboutiOverview: Djibouti remained a critical partner for the United States military and the region in the fight against terrorism.  Since 2002, Djibouti has hosted Camp Lemonnier, the headquarters of AFRICOM’s Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa and the only enduring U.S. military installation in Africa.  The Djibouti-based Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Center of Excellence for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (ICEPCVE) expanded operations in Djibouti and in the region by providing CVE training, research, and resources.  Djibouti’s Armed Forces also continued participation in the U.S.-funded Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program and deployed soldiers to the AMISOM campaign.As in previous years, Djiboutian government officials, particularly law enforcement and members of the High Islamic Council, worked closely to identify and address terrorist activity.  Djibouti joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2017.2019 Terrorist Attacks:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Djibouti in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no significant terrorism‑related legislative changes in 2019.  The government used CT legislation to suppress anti-government criticism by detaining and prosecuting political opposition figures and other activists.Djibouti’s law enforcement organization is composed of the Djiboutian National Police (DNP), the Djiboutian National Gendarmerie, the National Security Judiciary Police, and the Djiboutian Coast Guard.  The DNP controls border checkpoints and Djibouti’s armed forces are responsible for patrolling land borders in remote locations, with support from the Gendarme patrolling between border posts.  Djibouti continued to process travelers on entry and departure at its international airport and seaport with PISCES.  While the airport and seaport remain important entry points, the vast majority of travelers cross into Djibouti by land at one of three land border points, one of which is the Loyada crossing at the Somali border.The National Anti-Terrorism Taskforce held several terrorism-related exercises to respond to and prevent terrorist attacks at popular landmarks such as hotels.  The taskforce continued its collaboration with the foreign militaries stationed in Djibouti.In 2019, the Ministry of Justice created a national commission of experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ICEPCVE to finalize work on a national strategy to combat terrorism.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Djibouti is a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF), a FATF-style regional body.  In 2019, Djibouti’s FIU (SRF) organized four events on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):Two workshops on AML/CFT with the Center on Cooperation and Security Studies in October 2019.Two trainings for relevant personnel in the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Budget, and the Ministry of Economy in partnership with the European Union, FATF, the Egmont Centre of FIU Excellence and Leadership, France, the International Monetary Fund, and IGAD.The signing of an MOU by SRF on the exchange of financial information with countries in the region:  Ethiopia, Somalia, and Tanzania.There were no published law enforcement cases involving suspected terrorist financing in 2019, although SRF referred several cases of money laundering to law enforcement authorities.Countering Violent Extremism:  From July 1-3, 2019, ICEPCVE conducted a three-day CVE workshop, which brought together 25 religious leaders from the region to discuss their role in preventing religious intolerance at the community level.  Participants created multilingual public service announcements that were shared across the region to promote religious tolerance.  From 2018-2019, ICEPCVE used a U.S. government grant to solicit CVE research from academics in East Africa, providing $5,000 sub-grants to independent researchers to conduct CVE studies in their respective countries.  The research was concluded in December 2019 and will be presented at a regional conference.  Law enforcement agencies continued to work with the High Islamic Council to identify and monitor activity that promoted terrorist ideology.International and Regional Cooperation:  In 2019, there were no significant changes.  Djibouti hosts IGAD’s headquarters offices and secretary general.  The Djiboutian military continued its participation in AMISOM, which includes military forces from Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda.EritreaOverview: In May 2019, the Department of State removed Eritrea from the list of countries certified as “not cooperating fully” with U.S. CT efforts pursuant to section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act.  Eritrea had been on the list since 2008.  In considering this annual determination, the Department of State reviewed Eritrea’s overall level of cooperation with U.S. efforts to combat terrorism.  The Government of Eritrea took positive preliminary steps toward engagement with the United States on law enforcement and security in 2019.  A lack of transparency from the Eritrean government means there was no clear picture of the methods it used to track terrorists or protect its citizens.  In July and October, the government held initial coordination meetings with several U.S. law enforcement and CT-related agencies, opening a channel for information sharing and potential cooperation.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents in Eritrea in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Eritrean government continues to require all citizens to obtain an exit visa before airport departure.  Eritrea has poor internet connectivity, which makes use of the INTERPOL databases and biometric screening and information sharing at ports of entry problematic.  However, Eritrea does coordinate with INTERPOL, and customs and immigration officials do use INTERPOL notices or API/PNR data.  In July, the Eritrean government signed a partnership framework agreement with UNODC for comprehensive capacity building assistance to upgrade criminal justice and border security infrastructure, equipment, and practices.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  In September 2019, Eritrea was admitted as an observer and membership candidate in the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG), a FATF-style regional body.  Eritrea is a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, which has a maritime security program that focuses on building the capacity of law enforcement agencies to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government employs awareness raising campaigns, early warning tools, and community-level engagement to prevent and counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  It actively cultivates an ethos of social inclusion and mutual respect across the nine traditional ethnic groups, as well as among the leading religious denominations that make up Eritrean society.  It actively participates in regional CVE conferences, including one on “Empowering Youth and Promoting Tolerance” in Abu Dhabi from December 18-19.International and Regional Cooperation:  The government participated in an expert workshop on protecting critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks held in Johannesburg in November.  The government is a member of East African Police Chiefs and hosted a regional workshop for East African law enforcement agencies.EthiopiaOverview: Ethiopia’s political reform process continued in 2019 under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, facilitating even greater counterterrorism cooperation with the United States.  The continuing threat of al-Shabaab (AS) and ISIS emanating from Somalia is the Government of Ethiopia’s (GOE’s) core terrorism concern and the focal point of its security apparatus and the Ethiopia National Defense Force’s (ENDF) CT efforts.  In 2019, the GOE increased its collaboration with the United States on regional security issues and participated in trainings.  The GOE has provided the United States information, evidence, and access to witnesses who have contributed to FBI cases related to AS and other U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no confirmed terrorist incidents in Ethiopia in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The GOE uses its 2009 Anti-Terrorism Proclamation (ATP) to prosecute crimes associated with terrorist activity.  A Legal and Justice Affairs Advisory Council under the attorney general amended the ATP in 2019 in line with the broader opening of political space in the country.  The amended proclamation was submitted to and approved by Ethiopia’s Council of Ministers (COM) and as of 2019 is awaiting final approval by the House of Representatives.  Several Ethiopians arrested in relation to the June assassinations were charged under the 2009 ATP.The Attorney General’s office is working on revising Ethiopia’s Criminal Procedure Code to allow for more efficient CT prosecutions while still respecting rule-of-law standards; the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa worked with the GOE to include cooperation arrangements with relevant international partners, including the United States, on criminal matters in its revised Code.  As of 2019, the revised Code is with the COM for review prior to submission to the House of Representatives for approval.The ENDF, the Ethiopian Federal Police (EFP), Ethiopian intelligence, and regional special police worked to block AS attacks in Ethiopia.  The Ministry of Peace, which oversees the EFP and intelligence services, increased its public messaging, peace-building activities, and coordination role to combat the influence of AS and other groups.  The National Intelligence and Security Service continued to reorganize and reform to focus on collecting intelligence to detect and disrupt terrorism in support of EFP and attorney general efforts to conduct law enforcement investigations and prosecutions.Border security was a persistent concern for the GOE, and the government worked to tighten border controls with Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan.  Ethiopia employed PISCES to conduct traveler screening and watch listing at airports and other points of entry.  The GOE, in October, signed a memorandum of cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to implement the Automated Targeting System-Global, which complements PISCES and will allow the GOE to collect, use, and analyze API/PNR data.The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) continues to conduct semi-annual inspections of Ethiopia’s national carrier and annual assessments of Bole International Airport.  TSA partnered with security officials at Bole to provide aviation security assistance on two occasions in 2019.  The next assessment at Bole was scheduled for March 2020.  The relationship with Ethiopian aviation security officials is positive.  Ethiopia and the U.S. government concluded an arrangement to share terrorist identities to enhance immigration and border controls.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Ethiopia is a member of ESAAMLG, and Ethiopia’s FIU, the Ethiopian Financial Intelligence Centre, is a member of the Egmont Group.  In October 2019, Ethiopia demonstrated progress in addressing strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT system and was removed from FATF’s compliance process.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Ministry of Peace is the GOE’s lead on CVE, a priority for Prime Minister Abiy’s government given the threat from AS.  The GOE’s strategy focuses on reducing poverty and ethnic strife to eliminate factors that the GOE assesses enable AS recruitment.  The GOE remains engaged in local mediation and conflict mitigation strategies to defuse ethnic and religious tensions, especially in the Oromia, Afar, and Somali regions.  The GOE monitored “extremist” activities, particularly among the large Muslim youth population and given the significant economic migration of Ethiopians to the Middle East.  Some economic migrants return to Ethiopia radicalized.International and Regional Cooperation:  The GOE has attempted to improve its CT cooperation with Kenya and the Federal Government of Somalia to combat threats.  Ethiopian officials remain more willing since Abiy’s selection to cooperate with the U.S. government against AS.The GOE participated in African Union (AU)-led CT efforts as part of AU Mission in Somalia forces.  At the AU, Ethiopia participated in CT-related efforts.  Ethiopia participates in the IGAD and its CT programs and trainings, including the IGAD Security Sector Program, which builds regional capacity to mitigate, detect, and deter terrorist activity.  In multilateral efforts against terrorism, the GOE generally supports international directives that seek to stem terrorism.  IGAD, recognizing that terrorism is a transnational issue, continued to encourage the cross-border dissemination of information concerning terrorist activity.KenyaOverview: In 2019, Kenya suffered its worst terrorist attack in four years when al-Shabaab (AS) attacked the Dusit D2 hotel complex in Nairobi.  The use of a suicide vest and the targeting of civilians were notable.  Additionally, the region bordering Somalia continued to suffer attacks, particularly through IEDs and ambushes targeting Kenyan security forces and important infrastructure.A member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Kenya is a willing U.S. partner in CT investigation, prosecution, and incident response, and plays a leading role in regional CT cooperation.  The Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) continued to participate in AMISOM and supported border security and counter-IED efforts within Kenya.  Security services responded to numerous terrorist incidents, while also disrupting AS and ISIS attack planning, recruitment, and travel.  Reports of human rights violations by security forces during CT operations continued, including allegations of extra-judicial killings, disappearances, and torture.  In responding to the January 2019 DusitD2 Hotel attack, Kenyan security forces demonstrated improved procedures in line with international standards for protection of human rights in response to terrorist threats and attacks.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist incidents in 2019 included the following:On January 15-16, AS operatives attacked the Dusit2D hotel complex in Nairobi, killing 21 people and wounding 28 others.On February 16, media reported that AS killed three Christian teachers at a primary school in Wajir County, a predominantly Muslim region.On April 15, media reported that AS fighters killed one police officer and abducted two Cuban doctors in Mandera town.On June 15, an IED planted by AS destroyed a police vehicle, killing 11 police officers and injuring one in Wajir County.  The attackers also abducted three Kenya Police Reservists, according to government and media reporting.On October 26, media reported that AS used an IED to kill 11 General Service Unit (GSU) officers in Garissa County.On December 6, AS attacked a public bus and killed six police officers and four civilians in Wajir County, according to media and government reporting.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Kenya’s government continued to use the Prevention of Terrorism Act (amended in 2014) to investigate and prosecute terrorism.  Terrorism case trials often proceeded slowly and inefficiently.  For example, the three remaining defendants in the 2013 Westgate Mall attack are still on trial as of December.  Most delays are caused by crowded court dockets and the lack of continuous trials.  However, 2019 saw significant victories.  In March, the Supreme Court reinstated the convictions and 15-year sentences of two Iranians in a disrupted 2012 bomb plot that included scouted locations in Nairobi and Mombasa.  In June, a Kenyan court found three of four defendants guilty of the 2015 Garissa University massacre.  Despite these successes, some challenges persist.  The government has yet to fund a public defender service, which is critical to the success of its National Legal Aid Action Plan.  Access to defense counsel for terrorism suspects is limited.  In February, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) published national plea-bargaining rules, incorporating them into the Criminal Procedure Code.  Since then, the ODPP has been working to develop a uniform and consistent nationwide policy on plea negotiations.  The effective use of plea agreements could provide a mechanism for lower-level accomplices to cooperate against higher-level terrorism suspects.CT functions are divided among the three branches of the National Police Service:  1) the Kenya Police Service (including the paramilitary GSU; Traffic Police; and regional, county, and local police); 2) the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (including the investigative Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, Bomb Disposal Unit, and Cyber Forensics Investigative Unit); and 3) the Administration Police (including the Border Police Unit).  The National Intelligence Service, elements of the KDF, and the interagency also shared responsibility.  Uneven coordination, resource constraints, insufficient training, corruption, and unclear command and control continue to hinder counterterrorism effectiveness.  Kenya’s National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) continued to work with private security companies on preventing soft target attacks.  Kenya began preparations in 2019 to establish an interagency Joint Terrorism Task Force.Terrorists continued to exploit Kenya’s largely uncontrolled land borders to conduct attacks.  In 2019, Kenyan officials continued to build a border security strategy, but hurdles remain.  Under a June 2018 arrangement, Kenya is anticipated to receive U.S. Automated Targeting System‑Global (ATS-G) software, which facilitates screening of air travelers using API/PNR.  If deployed, ATS-G would be integrated with PISCES, the U.S. government-provided front line border management system, enhancing the capabilities of both systems to target potential threats and counter terrorist travel.  However, the passage of a data protection law in November has delayed the implementation of ATS-G.  To improve aviation safety and security at Nairobi’s International Airport, the Kenyan government established interagency Joint Operations Centers at several points of entry to promote information sharing.  Immigration officers also employed government watchlists.  Watchlist screening and basic equipment at smaller ports of entry were generally lacking.The Kenyan government worked to prevent the transit of FTFs, including Kenyans attempting to join AS or ISIS, and those returning from abroad.  Kenyan security services also detected and deterred terrorist plots and responded to dozens of terrorism-related incidents.  The Kenyan government cooperated on threat information and security at the U.S. Embassy, including through a dedicated GSU CT response team funded by U.S. assistance.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Kenya is a member of ESAAMLG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Kenya established County Action Plans for CVE in all 47 counties to further implement its National Strategy to Counter Violent Extremism.  The NCTC is seeking increased resourcing to implement these plans.  The NCTC also led Kenya’s Country Support Mechanism for GCERF, which awarded grants for community CVE initiatives.  Police in Nairobi, coastal, and northeastern counties participated in community engagement training and early warning and response programs.  Prison and justice sector stakeholders improved handling of terrorist suspects and convicts, and judicial officials are working to improve management of remand prisoners through plea bargaining and other methods.  NCTC’s “piloting” of small-scale efforts to disengage, rehabilitate, and reintegrate former terrorists lack a clear legal framework and supportive public messaging campaigns.  The Kenyan government hosted a high-level, international CT/CVE conference in July 2019.  Kenya’s second-largest city, Mombasa, is an active member of the Strong Cities Network.International and Regional Cooperation:  Nairobi continues to host the UN headquarters in Africa.  The KDF continued participation in AMISOM and is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  Although not a member, Kenya frequently participated in regional meetings of the GCTF and hosted a GCTF workshop in February.MaliOverview: The Government of Mali (GOM) is receptive to U.S. CT assistance.  Terrorist activities increased in quantity and lethality in 2019, and continued to target civilians, Mali’s Armed Forces (FAMa), international peacekeepers, and international military forces.  Terrorist groups active in Mali include ISIS in the Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS) and JNIM – the umbrella group formed by the Sahara Branch of al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb, al‑Murabitoun, Ansar al-Dine, and the Macina Liberation Front.  Possibly most concerning in the region is the increasing geographic expansion of terrorist activities, in many cases involving tactical-level cooperation between ISIS-GS and JNIM.Implementation of the 2015 Algiers peace accord between the GOM and two coalitions of armed groups continued to be limited, largely hindering the return of public services and security to northern Mali.  Terrorism, insecurity, scarce resources, and a lack of accountability or effective governance resulted in a significant increase in intercommunal violence, particularly in central Mali.  The conflict zone has continued to press farther south.  Efforts to secure the center of the country in 2019 were hampered by the limited availability of trained FAMa members and increasingly sophisticated and coordinated terrorist attacks against military installations.Mali has been cooperative in working with the United States to prevent acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens.  Malian security forces successfully disrupted several terrorist plots targeting soft-target venues frequented by Westerners in Bamako, such as hotels and restaurants; they arrested numerous terrorist suspects and seized stockpiles of weapons and explosives.Mali continued to rely heavily on MINUSMA and French forces to help marginally stabilize and secure the northern and central regions.  The French military’s Operation Barkhane, an integrated CT mission for the Sahel region, continued efforts to target terrorist elements operating in Mali.  MINUSMA maintained its presence in northern Mali in 2019 while taking on a greater role in protecting civilians in that region.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  JNIM and ISIS-GS continued to conduct terrorist attacks.  There were multiple terrorist incidents including the following significant attacks:On January 20, JNIM conducted a complex attack on a MINUSMA base near Aguelhok, in the Kidal region, which killed 10 Chadian peacekeepers and wounded 25.On June 9, armed men believed to be affiliated with JNIM killed at least 35 people in an attack against the predominantly Christian town of Sobane Da, Mopti Region, according to media reports.On September 3, an IED struck a civilian bus in Mopti, leaving 14 people dead and 24 wounded.  JNIM later issued an apology stating it regretted the deaths of “our brothers and sons” and that the IED was intended for the “French occupier and its acolytes.”On September 30, near the Burkina Faso border, simultaneous attacks on a FAMa post in Mondoro and a joint FAMa-G5 Sahel Joint Force base in Boulkessi by groups presumed to be terrorist elements left at least 38 FAMa soldiers dead, 17 wounded, and as many as 27 missing, according to the government’s mid-October reports.  JNIM subsequently took responsibility for the attack, claiming to have killed 85 soldiers.On November 1, members of ISIS-GS attacked a military base at Indelimane, Menaka region (near the border with Niger), killing at least 54 soldiers.  Authorities believe the perpetrators used a stolen Red Cross vehicle to approach the base.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no changes to Mali’s CT legal framework in 2019.  Mali’s highest criminal court tried 19 terrorism cases in 2019.  At least 12 of the cases resulted in convictions and sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment.Over the past year, the National Gendarmerie’s Security and Intervention Group (French acronym GSIGN), a U.S. embassy-trained advanced intervention unit, has been deployed to the Segou region in support of the government’s stabilization efforts.  The unit supported current gendarme posts, conducted patrols, and investigated suspicious activities.  Further gains were stymied by logistical constraints, including the lack of suitable patrol vehicles.  An expansion of the GSIGN program will create an additional six operational teams and provide logistical support, including vehicles, to conduct CT operations outside of Bamako.Malian law specifies that two of the services of the FAMa, the National Gendarmerie and the National Guard, carry out law enforcement CT tasks when called on by the Ministry of Security, the parent agency of the National Police.  They perform such functions ineffectively.  Mali’s interagency coordination and information sharing remain rudimentary.  Resource constraints, corruption, malfunctioning of the judicial system in prosecuting terrorist cases, lack of training and automated national criminal report management system for effective law enforcement, and insufficient border security all hamper Mali’s CT efforts.Although Mali has basic border security enforcement mechanisms, law enforcement units lacked capacity, training, and the necessary equipment to secure Mali’s porous borders, which extend about 4,500 miles and touch seven countries.  The Gendarmerie, which reports to both the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Security (MOS), and the National Border Police, which reports to the MOS, both provide support to prevent and deter criminal activity at borders.  Customs officials under the Ministry of Economy and Finance monitor the flow of goods and enforce customs laws at borders and ports of entry.  Mali receives INTERPOL notices, but the INTERPOL database is unavailable at some points of entry.  Exit and entry stamps used by border officials have inconsistent size and shape, undermining efforts to authenticate travel documents.  The government receives Public Key Infrastructure certificates for passport security information from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); however, the information sharing is done manually and inconsistently.Malian passports, including diplomatic and official versions, incorporate security measures including micro-printing, ultraviolet features, and a full-color digital photo.  Imposters can obtain fraudulent documents, such as birth and marriage certificates, with relative ease, effectively undermining the veracity of Malian identification documents.The GOM has made some progress toward the implementation of UNSCR 2396 regarding border security, by implementing biometric screening at established ports of entry.  However, Mali has little or no control over its borders; terrorists move across borders with ease.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Mali is a member of GIABA.  Mali’s FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Mali launched a new CVE strategy for the center of the country.  The strategy focuses on improving governance, reinforcing security, promoting development, and increasing communication with local citizens about the government’s actions.  In February the government issued a decree creating a national secretariat under the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Worship for the implementation of a new national CVE strategy.  The Ministry of Religious Affairs is responsible for the national strategy for the “prevention of radicalization and terrorism,” as well as working with religious associations to maintain a secular state.  The Ministry of Religious Affairs has been hampered in its efforts by a lack of resources and coordination with other ministries.  Religious leaders in Mali continue to call for religious toleration and denounce “extremist activity.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Mali remained active in regional organizations and international bodies, including ECOWAS, the UN, the AU, and TSCTP.  The Malian military participated in multinational border security operations under the G-5 Sahel mandate.  ECOWAS leaders pledged $1 billion in September 2019 to fight terrorism in the Sahel, including in Mali.  Although not a member, Mali also participated in GCTF regional workshops and events.MauritaniaOverview:  Mauritania remained a strong security and regional CT partner for the United States in 2019.  Despite continued terrorist violence in neighboring Mali and regional threats that included those against Mauritania, the country has not suffered a terrorist attack on its soil since 2011.  The government has continued its CT cooperation with the United States and welcomed opportunities to participate in U.S.-sponsored CT-focused trainings.  Countering terrorist activity remains a top priority for the Mauritanian government and armed forces, and this message is vigorously underscored by Mauritanian military leadership when appealing to donor nations for equipment and training assistance.  Restrictions on U.S. assistance to Mauritania under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act have limited U.S. foreign assistance for Mauritanian CT efforts.  On November 14, Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader of JNIM, made new threats against the Sahel countries, including Mauritania, that collaborate with France in the fight against terrorism.  In a seven-minute audio recording, the JNIM leader explained that the group was targeting the Sahel countries because of their alliance with France and asserted that the group’s latest attacks reflect the “failure” of the G5 Sahel Joint Force.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents in Mauritania in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no new terrorism cases pending before the courts.  The Ministry of Justice’s counterterrorism division is still working on two case files from last year in which six individuals arrested on drug trafficking charges are being investigated for possible links to terrorist groups.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Mauritania is a member of MENAFATF.  Throughout 2019, the government took steps to combat the financing of terrorism and money laundering.  In April, the Central Bank ordered 691 money transfer offices closed for failure to comply with the 2005 Law Against Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism.  In October, the government formally created the National Committee to Combat Money Laundering and the National Committee to Combat Terrorist Financing.  Chaired by the prime minister’s senior security advisor, the committees include the participation of the Central Bank governor as well as the ministers of economy, justice, interior, and other agencies with a view to improving internal government coordination on these issues.  The October decrees creating the committees also replaced the Central Bank’s FIU (known as CANIF) with a new Financial Investigations Unit.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Traditional Education (MIATE) partnered with the U.S. Embassy to implement CVE activities under the Sadaqa project.  Through this partnership, the MIATE facilitated the implementation of at least 85 CVE activities that reached more than 2,500 individuals in Nouakchott and the eastern regions of the country.  These activities included trainings on radicalization risk factors, conflict mediation, youth engagement, and effective media and communications, and they also leveraged the ministry’s adult literacy programs across these regions to conduct CVE events.  The U.S. Embassy also partnered with the Ministries of Interior, Youth, and MIATE to design and implement a Youth Mediator for Peace Network consisting of 13 core leaders who implemented relevant CVE activities in their respective regions.  On October 7, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs launched a CVE center located within the University of Islamic Sciences in Aioun, Hodh el Gharbi region to study various manifestations of terrorism and the best methods to address it.International and Regional Cooperation:  Mauritania hosts the headquarters of the G5 Sahel regional organization, which comprises Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania.  The G5 combats regional terrorism and promotes development and governance within and across Sahel member countries.  Mauritania assumes the rotating presidency of the G5 Sahel in 2020.  In June, the Nouakchott-based G5 Sahel Defense College graduated its first class of 36 mid-career officers, which included 16 Mauritanian officers in addition to 20 officers evenly distributed from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad.  In September, the G5 Sahel Defense College provided the first session of instruction specifically for officers from the five countries on secondment to the G5 Sahel Joint Force.On July 29, Mauritania announced that it was sending a representative to the headquarters of the International Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition led by Saudi Arabia.MozambiqueOverview:  Mozambique experienced a significant increase in terrorist activity in 2019.  ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique carried out numerous attacks in northern Mozambique and Tanzania, resulting in the estimated deaths of 350 civilians and the internal displacement of 100,000 people.  The Government of the Republic of Mozambique continued security operations against the ISIS-affiliated group in 2019 and made numerous arrests of terrorist suspects.  In June 2019, ISIS began claiming responsibility for attacks.  Reports indicate that from September to November 2019, Russia provided operational support for government-led CT operations.  ISIS attacks in this area have threatened employees of an international liquid natural gas consortium, in which a U.S. company is a participant, and have prompted the consortium to approach further investment in Mozambique with caution.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  With limited exception, ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique reportedly conducted weekly or even more frequent attacks on rural villages in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado Province.  The attacks varied in intensity and scale, but generally included the use of firearms, edged weapons, and arson.  The attacks often included the theft of food and other basic supplies and have displaced at least 100,000 people.  In 2019, in addition to targeting civilians, ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique conducted increasing attacks against security forces and vehicles.  Fighters connected to ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique are frequently reported to wear stolen police or military uniforms.  Access constraints and limited reporting on the violence render reports of attacks difficult to verify.  The following list details a small fraction of the reported incidents that occurred:On February 21, terrorists attacked a convoy associated with the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation between Mocimboa da Praia and the Afungi Peninsula, killing one contractor.On July 3, terrorists killed seven people, including a police officer and two children, in Lidjungo village, Nangade District.  ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique claimed responsibility for the attack.On September 10, in two separate attacks in Muidumbe and Macomia Districts, ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique burned 70 houses, vandalized a primary school, and set fire to a hospital.  They killed seven police officers and one civilian, and allegedly kidnapped four women.On October 13, ISIS’s affiliate in Mozambique reportedly clashed with Mozambican and Russian security forces, resulting in the deaths of 10 soldiers.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Mozambique’s current CT legislation was passed in 2018.  The law provides for the punishment of anyone committing, planning, preparing, or participating in terrorist acts and stipulates punishment for individuals who travel or attempt to travel to join a terrorist organization.  As of July 2019, the government reported 130 convictions related to violence in Cabo Delgado Province.  To date, prosecutions have been treated as murders, arsons, and assaults, not as terrorist acts.In 2019, Mozambican law enforcement entities, including the national police force, Rapid Intervention Unit, and National Criminal Investigative Service engaged in CT operations and activity in northern Mozambique.  Mozambique does not have a CT strategy to guide operations in the North, and law enforcement agencies lack the training, equipment, and overall capacity to proactively detect, deter, or prevent acts of terrorism.  Though law enforcement entities operate as part of a joint task force with military counterparts, coordination, strategic planning, interagency communications, and intelligence sharing remain significant challenges.Border security remains a significant security challenge for Mozambique.  Terrorists are known to cross the porous border into and from Tanzania, which serves as a recruitment and transit point for terrorist and criminal organizations.  Government representatives from Mozambique and Tanzania have convened meetings following two 2019 attacks that resulted in the deaths of Tanzanian citizens and have publicly reconfirmed commitments to a 2018 memorandum of understanding between the two countries’ police forces.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Mozambique is a member of ESAAMLG.  Mozambique is also a member of the Asset Recovery Inter-Agency Network for Southern Africa (known as ARINSA).  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Mozambique does not have a CVE national action plan, as recommended by the UN Secretary-General’s Preventing Violent Extremism Plan of Action, but acknowledges the need for a response to terrorist violence that includes community engagement in addition to security force activity.  As of November, the government was working on a five-year action plan to deter youth from engaging in terrorism.  Publicly, the government refers to terrorists as “evildoers” or “insurgents.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Mozambique is a member of the AU and the Southern African Development Community but does not regularly engage on counterterrorism efforts within these organizations.  Mozambique is a member of the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism and has security cooperation MOUs with regional and international partners to include Malawi, India, Russia, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United Kingdom (UK).NigerOverview: Niger faces terrorist threats on five of its seven national borders.  The Government of Niger (GoN) remains committed to denying terrorists safe haven within its territory.  It cooperated with its neighbors and with international partners, including INTERPOL, and is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the Multi-National Joint Task Force, and the G5 Sahel Joint Force.  Terrorist organizations take advantage of Niger’s lengthy borders and sparsely populated desert regions to move fighters, weapons, and other contraband.  Terrorist organizations recruit among border populations, where access to government services are weak and economic opportunity is negligible.  In the West, terrorist organizations leveraged a sense of injustice and a desire for protection stemming from historic farmer-herder violence.  Niger’s efforts to fight terrorism are challenged by its small defense force, strained coordination between security services, budget shortfalls, and continuing instability in Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali, and the Lake Chad Basin.  Instability in the bordering nations has led to multiple terrorist incursions into Niger.Terrorist groups active in Niger included ISIS in the Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), BH, ISIS-WA, and JNIM, which is an amalgamation of the Sahara Branch of al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Murabitoun, Ansar al-Dine, and the Macina Liberation Front.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist organizations carried out dozens of attacks in Niger during 2019.  Two main fronts saw attacks: from BH or ISIS-WA in the Southeast, and from al-Qa’ida (AQ) affiliates and ISIS-GS in the West and the Northwest.On January 14, an ambulance carrying civilians was struck by an IED in the Tillabery region, two civilians were killed and six were injured.On January 28, suspected members of BH attacked a village in the Diffa region. Four civilians were killed and three wounded.  Several vehicles and a large amount of food were stolen from the village.On February 17, a female suicide bomber likely affiliated with BH or ISIS-WA detonated her vest at a refugee camp in the Diffa region and four civilians were killed.On March 27, suspected members of BH attacked a village in the Diffa region. Fourteen civilians were killed. The attackers utilized two suicide bombers and set fire to several residences.  The attackers also kidnapped four villagers during this incursion.On April 26, suspected members of BH attacked the Doctors Without Borders compound in the Diffa region. Two civilians were injured in the attack.  The attackers burned several buildings and vehicles within the compound.On October 9, suspected terrorists attacked a village in the Tahoua region and kidnapped the village chief.On May 14, a Nigerien Army Special Forces platoon was ambushed in the Tongo region that resulted in 29 GoN soldiers killed and many more wounded.  The terrorist attackers were likely affiliated with ISIS-GS.On December 10, attackers struck a Nigerien military base in the Inates region.  More than 70 soldiers were killed, and several vehicles and equipment were taken.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  On December 14, 2018, the GoN passed an amendment to its Penal Code that provides either conditional amnesty or a mitigated sentence for terrorists who voluntarily surrender to authorities.  Shortly after the passage of the amendment, the GoN adopted on February 14, 2019, a corresponding decree making the Goudoumaria Defection Center an official GoN entity.  Together, these two pieces of legislation ratify Niger’s National Program for Managing Defectors from BH and ISIS-WA.  Following the ceremony, 125 defectors were reinserted into communities throughout the Diffa region.  A smaller second wave of defectors are expected to graduate and be reinserted in January 2020, following their successful completion of vocational training.Niger’s laws criminalized acts of terrorism consistent with international instruments and best practices under the civil law system.  Niger finalized a National Border Security Strategy in 2018 with support from the U.S. Global Security Contingency Fund, an interagency program between the U.S. Departments of Defense, Justice, and State.  In December 2019, Niger’s National Assembly passed an amendment to last year’s law defining the conditions under which a person associated with BH or ISIS-WA could benefit from support services, allowing increased international cooperation for the Disarmament, Deradicalization, and Reintegration (DDR) of former BH participants.Counterterrorism investigations are primarily the responsibility of the Central Service for the Fight against Terrorism and Transnational Organized Crime (SCLCT-CTO), an interagency body comprising representatives from Niger’s National Police, National Guard, and Gendarmerie.  Niger continued to use rudimentary terrorism watchlists that it shares with the security services and at border checkpoints.  Since 2017, it moved more than 700 of about 1,400 BH-related detainees fully through its criminal justice system.Niger is recognized by regional partners as a leader in processing and prosecuting terrorist incidents using dedicated counterterrorism apparatuses such as SCLCT-CTO and the Special Antiterrorism Judicial Pole.  SCLCT-CTO benefits from specialized training, equipment, and persistent mentorship provided by DOS’s ATA Program.  The GoN also signed an agreement with the U.S. government to establish protocols to improve the use of battlefield evidence and train Nigerien security forces accordingly.Niger continues to enhance its capacity to detect and deter terrorist incursions at its borders and ports of entry through the expansion of new technologies, critical infrastructure development, and additional specialized security forces assigned along the border, including:PISCES;MIDAS, and coordination with INTERPOL;Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire headquarters and communications build out – funded by INL;Cellule Mixte de Contrôle des Frontières, the Groupes d’Action Rapides – Surveillance et Intervention, and GIS; and,A joint Regional Security Office/Operation Safe Corridor border security training initiative focused on the Burkina Faso border departments of Say, Ayorou, Tera, and Torodi.Although the GoN recognizes the importance strengthening its borders in the fight against terrorism, it was dependent on international partnerships to fund and implement these initiatives.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Niger is a member of the Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa, a Financial Action Task Force-style regional body.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Government of Niger undertook CVE projects supported by international partners and nongovernmental organizations, including CVE radio programming, sensitization caravans, peace committees, and youth symposia.  Local leaders in Diffa continued DDR efforts supported by the Ministry of Interior and the High Authority for the Consolidation of the Peace.  Local authorities have set up and trained more than 400 village-level peace committees to strengthen communities’ involvement in monitoring and addressing terrorist threats.International and Regional Cooperation:  Niger is a member of and contributes troops to MNJTF and the G5 Sahel.  Nigerien officials hosted and attended multiple international meetings on stabilizing Libya and on countering BH or ISIS-WA.Niger is also a member of ECOWAS and is party to its agreements on counter-trafficking and illicit financing.  Nigerien President Issoufou Mahamadou chaired an ECOWAS Summit on Terrorism in Ouagadougou on September 14, 2019, aimed at coordinating efforts among West African nations to combat terrorism.  Niger is a member of the TSCTP.NigeriaOverview:  BH and ISIS-WA continued attacks against government and security forces and civilians in the Northeast, resulting in deaths, injuries, abductions, and the capture and destruction of property.  ISIS-WA generally focused on attacking government and security forces and applying increased pressure on transport routes across Borno State, and it tried to cultivate stronger ties with local communities, including by providing limited social services and eliminating moderate leaders.  BH attacks did not appear to discriminate between civilians and government officials when conducting attacks.Nigeria worked with affected neighbors under the Multinational Joint Task Force to counter BH and ISIS-WA and regain control over territory.  However, civil society and Nigerian press reported significant human rights issues with the government’s counterterrorism efforts, and BH and ISIS-WA continued to enjoy nearly complete freedom of movement throughout northern Borno State and eastern Yobe State.To date, terrorist actions by BH and ISIS-WA have contributed to the internal displacement of about two million people within the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, and the external displacement of more than 240,000 Nigerian refugees to neighboring countries, principally Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.  On October 5, the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) campaign marked 2,000 days since 276 students were abducted by BH from Chibok, Borno State, in 2014.  According to BBOG representatives, 112 students remained missing at the end of 2019.  BBOG organizers noted that while most of the 113 students abducted from Dapchi, Yobe State in 2018 had been released, one student remains in the custody of insurgents.Nigeria is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the TSCTP, and the U.S. Security Governance Initiative.  The Department of Defense continued to coordinate with the Nigerian military at the Nigerian Defense Intelligence Agency, the Joint Combined Fusion Cell, and the Joint Coordination Planning Committee.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  BH and ISIS-WA carried out hundreds of attacks in Nigeria using small arms, captured military equipment, IEDs (including person-borne and vehicle-borne), ambushes, and kidnappings.  The following list details only a fraction of the incidents that occurred:On February 12, suspected ISIS-WA terrorists attacked the convoy of then-Governor of Borno State as it drove from the capital of Maiduguri to a town near Nigeria’s border with Cameroon; as many as ten were reportedly killed.On June 12, suspected BH terrorists killed at least 30 people and injured 42 when three IEDs were detonated at a market in Konduga, Borno State.On July 18, suspected ISIS-WA terrorists attacked a convoy of Action Against Hunger (AAH) and health ministry employees in Borno State.  One AAH driver was killed, while one AAH staff member, two drivers, and three health ministry workers remained missing, reportedly taken as hostages.  On September 25, media reported ISIS-WA said it had executed one of the missing aid workers.  On December 13, ISIS-WA said it had killed four of the five remaining hostages.On July 27, suspected BH terrorists killed at least 65 people near the Borno State capital.  Local officials said that, while some were killed as they returned from a funeral procession, around 40 civilians were killed when they pursued their attackers.  Officials also said this may have been a reprisal attack as two weeks earlier, residents had repelled an attack killing 11 suspected terrorists.On 26 December, ISIS-WA released a video claiming to show the execution of 11 Christians and claimed the killings were revenge for the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no changes to Nigeria’s CT legal framework in 2019.  The draft Terrorism Prohibition and Prevention Bill of 2017 lapsed at the close of the 2018 National Assembly and must be re-introduced.The Office of the National Security Advisor (ONSA) is responsible for coordinating all security and enforcement agencies, including the Department of State Security (DSS), Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Ministry of Justice, and Nigeria Police Force (NPF), which has a CT Unit and Terrorist Investigation Branch.The government continued processing hundreds of individuals suspected of supporting BH and ISIS-WA.  Despite their acquittal, at the end of the year many of these individuals remained in detention facilities in Niger and Borno states awaiting completion of a mandated de-radicalization program or transfer to state-owned transit centers for reintegration into their home communities.  For example, in November, nearly a thousand individuals in Borno State were released from Giwa barracks to the Bulumkutu rehabilitation center.  These individuals are expected to remain in transit centers while the International Organization on Migration conducts individual data collection and screening.  Human rights groups alleged that terrorist suspects detained by the military were denied their rights to legal representation, to due process, and to be heard by a judicial authority.Border security responsibilities are shared among the NPF, DSS, NSCDC, Customs, Immigration, and the Nigerian military.  Coordination among agencies was limited.The Nigerian government continued to work with the FBI to investigate specific terrorism matters, predominantly through the DSS.  ONSA and the NPF provided IED components to the FBI for analysis at the Terrorist Device Analysis Center.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Nigeria is a member of GIABA.  Nigeria’s Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) was readmitted to the Egmont Group in 2018 after implementation of a law that made the NFIU independent of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government continued Operation Safe Corridor, aimed at identifying and reintegrating former low-threat supporters of terrorist organizations.  OSC increased the de-radicalization program from 12 weeks to a 24-week program in recognition of the effort needed to conduct vital activities such as capacity building and profiling individuals at the center.  By year’s end, at least 268 individuals, including 86 children, had completed the program and were reintegrated into society.Building on the National Action Plan on Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration (DDRR), which was endorsed by the Nigerian Government in 2018, the ONSA convened the DDRR Action Plan Operational Project Team (OPT) in January.  The OPT is tasked with implementing the ten outcomes listed in the DDR action plan.  Members of the OPT include ONSA, OSC, the Joint Investigation Committee, the Defence Intelligence Agency, Defence Headquarters, the Nigerian Prison Service, the NPF, the International Organization on Migration, and state representatives.International and Regional Cooperation:  Nigeria continued high-level participation in regional security and CT conferences.  Nigeria is a member of GCTF and co-chairs the GCTF Criminal Justice and Rule of Law Working Group with Switzerland.  Nigeria also is an International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law Board Member.  In September, Nigeria hosted a delegation from GCERF.SenegalOverview:  Although there were no reported terrorist attacks in Senegal in 2019, the Government of Senegal increasingly considers itself a likely potential target given ongoing terrorist activities in West Africa.  In light of these concerns, Senegal continued to work closely with U.S. military and law enforcement officials to strengthen its CT capabilities.The risk of terrorist activity in Senegal arises from external and internal factors.  Externally, the growing terrorist threats across the region and the prevalence of multiple active terrorist groups in neighboring Mali risks spilling across the border into Senegal and threatening stability.  Senegal has taken steps to combat this threat, particularly in Mali, by contributing troops to MINUSMA.  Internally, the promotion of “extremist ideologies” by a small number of religious leaders constituted the chief concern; however, these ideologies remain outside Senegal’s prevailing Islamic norms.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Senegal in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no significant changes to Senegal’s CT legal framework in 2019.  Senegal continued to enhance the capabilities of its Inter-Ministerial Framework for Intervention and Coordination of CT Operations (CICO).  CICO, formed in 2016, is designed to coordinate the government’s response to terrorism.In 2019, the Superior Court of Dakar adjudicated and published written decisions on three terrorism cases, two involving online threats, and a third involving money transfers to insurgent hotspots in Mali.  Resolution of all three cases involved international cooperation (two with France and the third with Mali).  At the end of 2019, the court was also handling three cases with possible terrorist links.  One involved the seizure of AK-47 ammunition stolen from a military depot in Dakar.  The second involved 12mm ammunition purchased from a Lebanese munitions dealer in Dakar and destined for Mauritania.  In both cases, the alleged drivers of vehicles seized transporting the ammunition caches reported making several similar trips before being apprehended.  The third case involved a legislator caught in an undercover operation selling false currency, including West African CFA francs, Euros, and U.S. dollars, with a face value exceeding $50 million.  The legislator was arrested after a cooperating witness identified him as the distributor in the false-currency ring.Senegal’s gendarmerie and national police have specialized units to detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism.  Challenges remain to effective interagency cooperation and information sharing between the various governmental bodies that have CT functions in the country.Senegal continued to improve its law enforcement capacity by participating in multilateral efforts, such as the GCTF’s West Africa working group, AU programs, and ECOWAS.  Additionally, Senegal continued to work with the International Organization for Migration to promote cooperation and coordination between border agencies.Senegalese officials remained concerned that gaps in border protection resources and regional cooperation created security vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities were exacerbated by the absence of systems to verify travel document security, the effective use of terrorist screening watchlists, and the capabilities of biographic and biometric screening collection beyond those deployed at major ports of entry.  To combat these vulnerabilities, as of December 2019, the Senegalese government agreed to sign in January 2020 a Memorandum of Understanding to implement U.S. Custom and Border Protection’s Automated Targeting System-Global.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Senegal is a member of GIABA.  Senegal’s FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (CENTIF), is a member of the Egmont Group.  In September 2019, Senegal’s Ministry of Finance issued three implementing decrees to clarify and fill gaps in the provisions of its 2018 AML/CFT law.  These decrees created the National Anti-Money Laundering Committee to strengthen domestic coordination of AML/CFT efforts, strengthen oversight of certain businesses and professions that handle large volumes of money (attorneys, casinos, and nongovernmental organizations), and reorganize and enhance the autonomy of CENTIF.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Senegal is a member of the AU, ECOWAS, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and TSCTP.  Although not a member of the GCTF, Senegal participated in regional workshops and activities held by the GCTF West Africa Region Capacity Building Working Group.  The French and the EU provided financial support and training to reinforce Senegal’s CT and border security capabilities.  In November, the Government of Senegal hosted the Sixth Dakar International Forum on Peace and Security in Africa, which continued to focus on terrorism and related regional instability.SomaliaOverview:  The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) remained a committed partner of the United States in the ongoing fight against al-Shabaab (AS) and ISIS-Somalia, taking significant steps to implement security sector and other institutional reforms designed to improve its CT capabilities.  However, AS retained de facto control over significant portions of the country, particularly in south-central Somalia, continuing to move freely, collect “taxes,” and exert governing authority in the areas under its control.  AS conducted multiple significant and high-profile terrorist attacks in Somalia and appeared to increasingly use targeted assassinations against key government figures and community leaders to undermine the credibility and effectiveness of Somali government institutions.AMISOM, Somali National Army (SNA), and U.S. forces increased the level of pressure against AS in parts of Somalia in 2019, primarily intending to disrupt the flow of IEDs into the capital Mogadishu.  In April 2019, in cooperation with the United States and AMISOM, the FGS launched an operation to retake key territory near Mogadishu from AS control; the FGS is preparing further operations for 2020.AS also continued to attack targets in the border area between Somalia and Kenya.  Further, ISIS-Somalia remains involved in fundraising, intimidation campaigns, and assassinations in Mogadishu and northern Somalia.  Somalia is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Key terrorist incidents within Somalia in 2019 included:On February 28, three VBIED attacks in Mogadishu killed at least 30 people near the popular Makka al-Mukarama hotel.  AS claimed responsibility.On March 23, in a complex attack that lasted several hours, attackers killed at least five people, including the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, after detonating multiple IEDs in Mogadishu, including at a government compound hosting Labor and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Public Works.  AS claimed responsibility.On July 12, one American died after a complex attack – involving a VBIED and multiple gunmen – on the Asasey hotel in Kismayo, Somalia.  Media reported 27 total casualties.  AS claimed responsibility.On July 24, a blind female suicide bomber killed herself and seven other people, including Mogadishu Mayor Abdirahman Omar Osman, during a security meeting in the mayor’s office.  AS claimed responsibility.On September 30, assailants detonated a VBIED outside Baledogle Military Airfield, then launched an attack at the SNA base.  SNA forces repelled the attack with no deaths or injuries.  On the same day, a VBIED targeted an EU convoy in Mogadishu, injuring multiple Somali civilians.  AS claimed responsibility.On December 28, more than 80 people were killed by a truck bomb on the outskirts of Mogadishu, according to preliminary reports.  AS claimed responsibility.Legislation, Law Enforcement and Border Security:  FGS remained a willing partner to U.S. efforts to improve the quality of policing entities throughout the country, especially the CT and criminal investigation capabilities of the Somali Police Force (SPF).  In 2019, the FGS took renewed interest in police reform, appointing new leadership to key posts, including the SPF commissioner.  Additionally, on September 8, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Justice, Military Courts, the Attorney General’s Office, the Ministry of Internal Security, SPF, and the Somali Bar Association approved a U.S.-supported roadmap for transferring serious cases from military to civilian courts.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Somalia is a member of MENAFATF.  In 2019, FGS continued to strengthen institutional AML/CFT efforts, including support for the Financial Reporting Center, the country’s FIU, which began operations in November 2018.  Commercial banks and “hawala” money transfer bureau compliance officers, in accordance with legislation and regulations, have been submitting suspicious transaction and large currency transaction reports to the FRC on a monthly basis.  The Central Bank of Somalia adopted its first-ever strategic plan, which identified full implementation of an AML/CFT framework as its number one strategic goal.Somalia finalized AML/CFT regulations in September, which will operationalize the government’s ability to monitor financial transactions and take action to investigate potential terrorism financing.  The government also adopted regulations governing mobile money transactions in August to close gaps in the AML/CFT regime and more closely monitor the substantial movement of money through services provided by the telecommunications sector.Countering Violent Extremism: The FGS Office of the Prime Minister is responsible for coordinating government efforts and international support for CVE.  The Prevention and Countering Violent Extremism Coordinator was established in 2018 and now leads a regular working group.  The National Strategy for Public Awareness was established by the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Tourism in 2018 as a three-year strategy that includes specific lines of effort for CVE through the media.  Following the February 2017 presidential election, the FGS announced its intent to offer amnesty to any AS member willing to denounce terrorism and support the FGS.  A donor-supported effort to reintegrate former AS combatants continues, primarily through reintegration centers operating in Mogadishu, Kismayo, and Baidoa.  Somalia is also a newly established GCERF beneficiary country.International and Regional Cooperation:  The FGS continued to partner closely with AMISOM to help enable the transition of security responsibilities from AMISOM to Somali security forces.  Between February and March 2019, 1,000 Burundi National Defense Forces left Somalia as part of the first scheduled drawdown for AMISOM forces.  The next drawdown of AMISOM forces is scheduled for February 2020.South AfricaOverview:  South Africa saw a decrease in suspected terrorism-related incidents in 2019, following an unusually high number of incidents in 2018.  ISIS facilitation networks and cells remained a threat, after being first publicly acknowledged by the South African government in 2016.  Regional dynamics were an increasing concern as terrorist groups made gains in parts of the South African Development Community region, including Mozambique.  The government continued to prosecute alleged terrorists charged in previous years and arrested members of an alleged white supremacist terrorist group.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no changes to South Africa’s legislative framework in 2019.  The Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act criminalizes acts of terrorism, as well as the financing of terrorism, and sets out specific obligations related to international cooperation.  The Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act of 1998 applies to nationals who attempt to or who have joined terrorist organizations like ISIS.  The Crimes Against the State Unit within the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, and South Africa’s State Security Agency are tasked with detecting, deterring, and preventing acts of terrorism within South Africa.  The South African Police Service (SAPS) Special Task Force is specifically trained and proficient in CT, counterinsurgency, and hostage rescue.  The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is committed to prosecuting cases of terrorism and international crime.  The Department of Justice submitted a cybercrimes bill to Parliament in 2017, aimed at halting the spread of malicious communications over the internet.  Parliament is still reviewing the bill.Border security is challenging in South Africa because of to its numerous land, sea, and air ports of entry for international travelers.  South Africa has multiple law enforcement agencies policing its borders, but they are often stove-piped.  Inadequate communication, along with a lack of equipment, limits their border control ability.  The Department of Home Affairs submitted the Border Management Authority Bill to Parliament in 2016 to create an integrated and coordinated agency to ensure effective control of the border.  Parliament is still reviewing the bill.  CT measures at the international airports include screening with advanced technology X-ray machines, but land borders do not have advanced technology and infrastructure.  Trafficking networks made use of these land borders for many forms of illicit smuggling.  Citizens of neighboring countries are not required to obtain visas for brief visits.  Regulation of visa, passport, and identity documents remained a challenge within South Africa.  The SAPS internal affairs office investigated allegations of corruption within the Department of Home Affairs concerning the illicit sale of passports and identity documents, but the use of illegitimately obtained identity documents continued.In 2019, South Africa’s NPA continued to prosecute terrorism crimes.  In an effort to decentralize prosecution of terrorism cases, and to provide opportunities for provincially based prosecutors to gain experience in terrorism cases, the NPA’s Gauteng-based Priority Crimes Litigation Unit (PCLU) returned prosecutors seconded to the central unit back to their previous provincial assignments and reassigned terrorism cases to attorneys in the judicial districts where the crimes occurred.  Although the PCLU retained an oversight role, it gave provincial prosecutors substantial autonomy to direct terrorism cases as they see fit.  Progress in several high-profile cases slowed as newly assigned NPA provincial prosecutors had to become familiar with the cases and develop prosecutions strategies.  These included the previously reported prosecutions of the terrorist group allegedly responsible for the 2018 attacks on a Shia mosque and incendiary attacks against commercial interest in Durban, as well as of Sayefudeen Del Vecchio and Fatima Patel, who were charged in 2018 with the killing of British-South African dual nationals Rodney and Rachel Saunders.In November, South African Police arrested four members of the National Christian Resistance Movement, a white supremacist group allegedly planning attacks targeting shopping malls, informal settlements, and government installations.  In December, the four suspects were charged under the Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorism and Related Activities Act.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  South Africa is a member of FATF and of ESAAMLG.  South Africa’s FIU, the Financial Intelligence Centre, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The UN CTED 2018 report notes that the 2013 National CT Strategy in South Africa, which continued to be implemented in 2019, is classified confidential because it is operational in nature.  The Strategy is based on five pillars:  1) Understanding and Prediction; 2) Prevent; 3) Mitigation; 4) Combating; and 5) Response – Dealing with the Consequences.  It is supported by an Implementation Plan – as well as time frames for implementation, assessment, and reassessment – and is updated annually.International and Regional Cooperation:  South Africa is a member of the AU, GCTF, and the Southern African Development Corporation.TanzaniaOverview:  In 2019, the Governments of Tanzania and the United States engaged in limited CT cooperation, with most of the engagement focused on capacity building and border security.  The continuation of terrorist attacks in northern Mozambique, which include both Tanzanian perpetrators and victims, led to continued assurances of Mozambican and Tanzanian cross-border security cooperation.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  On June 26, armed attackers killed 11 people, including nine Tanzanians, in Ntole village, Mozambique.  Government sources attributed the attack to Ansar al-Sunna, locally known as “al-Shabaab,” a terrorist group since identified to be affiliated with Islamic State – Central African Province in Mozambique.  Media reported that the attackers were Tanzanians who planned the attack from within Tanzania.  Following the June attack, the chiefs of police from Mozambique and Tanzania met to coordinate the security response.In November, armed men dressed in Tanzanian Peoples Defense Forces military uniforms killed six villagers in Ngongo village, Mtwara Region, Tanzania.  It is believed the attackers came from Mozambique and carried out the attack in response to villagers alerting police to a large group of migrants en route to Mozambique days earlier.  Although unidentified, due to the proximity to Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique, the attackers likewise may have been affiliated with Ansar al-Sunna.Media and research points to the presence of Tanzanians among East African terrorist groups, including ADF, al-Shabaab, and ISIS.  In July, ISIS released a pledge video from the “Wilayah Central Africa.”  The pledge video, delivered in Swahili, calls on Muslims to unite and pledge allegiance to the “Khalifa.”  Risks of attacks in Tanzania remain high, exacerbated by possible cooperation among terrorists in the DRC, Mozambique, and Kenya who seek to take advantage of lightly governed spaces and porous borders, including the return of trained and radicalized Tanzanian terrorists from foreign theaters.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In November 2019, Tanzania amended the Prevention of Terrorism Act to specifically prohibit terrorist financing.Tanzania serves as a recruitment and transit point for terrorist and criminal organizations that capitalize on vast unguarded border space.In July, Tanzanian police announced the arrest of five suspects who were associates of the June 26 attackers in Ntole, Mozambique.  Bilateral partners and researchers also reported scores of arrests of people attempting to cross from Mtwara, Tanzania, into Cabo Delgado, Mozambique.Tanzania’s National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) leads the government’s coordination on CT issues but remains under-resourced and maintains no legal mandate to investigate or arrest suspects.Tanzanian military and police leadership acknowledges the existence of terrorists in Tanzania and Mozambique and claims to be working with local populations to increase border security.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Tanzania is a member of ESAAMLG.  Tanzania’s FIU, the Tanzania Financial Intelligence Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  In November 2019, Tanzania amended the Prevention of Terrorism Act to include specific mention of prohibiting the proliferation of terrorism financing.  Throughout 2019, the United States funded AML/CFT training to Ministry of Finance officials.In 2019, Tanzania continued efforts to regulate the movement of foreign exchange.  While the primary purpose of the restrictions appears to be reduction of tax evasion, the measures also make it easier to trace transactions, including those associated with money laundering.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, NCTC continued its partnership with the UNDP in a multi-year CVE project that began in spring 2017.  The UNDP CVE project includes funding to develop a national CVE strategy and action plan, originally envisioned to be completed in 2018.  Tanzania and UNDP reportedly made progress on the strategy in 2019 and both institutions assure partners it will be finalized in 2020.In 2019, the U.S. government provided funding for CVE activities with civil society actors in vulnerable areas.  Regional and district government levels do not have a clear understanding of CVE, which has hindered progress in implementing certain measures.  Additionally, police-community relations, especially in Muslim-majority regions along the coast, are strained due to heavy handed tactics by the police force.International and Regional Cooperation:  In 2019, Tanzania pursued training from bilateral and multilateral donors to enhance CT-related security units.  Tanzania has not prioritized working through regional bodies, including the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community on security and CT issues.UgandaOverview:  The Government of Uganda (GOU) continued to make important contributions toward CT efforts in East Africa and the Horn of Africa in 2019.  As the largest troop contributing country to AMISOM, Uganda remained a key partner in regional efforts to neutralize al-Shabaab.  However, in April, ISIS claimed responsibility for attacks in eastern DRC conducted by the ADF, a historically anti-Kampala armed group based in that area.  This was the first claim by ISIS of an attack in the region and highlighted the persistent threat of terrorism in Uganda.Terrorist Incidents:  No terrorist incidents occurred inside Uganda in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The GOU is increasingly concerned by security threats – terrorist and criminal – along Uganda’s western border with the DRC, particularly from the ADF, which has a long history of killing civilians and planning attacks against Ugandan interests.  However, no notable changes to Uganda’s border security posture occurred in 2019, nor were there significant legislation or law enforcement developments specific to CT.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Uganda is a member of ESAAMLG, and Uganda’s FIU, known as the Financial Intelligence Authority, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The GOU has made progress in drafting its CVE national action plan, as recommended by the UN Secretary-General’s Preventing Violent Extremism Plan of Action, according to police and military officials.  However, the government has not yet shared the draft with security partners, nor committed to a date for its release.International and Regional Cooperation:  Uganda participates in CT efforts through its membership in the United Nations, AMISOM, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the East African Community, PREACT, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  Uganda participated in discussions convened by the Government of the DRC with a subset of regional partners twice in 2019 to discuss countering armed groups in eastern DRC.  Ultimately, the GOU opted not to participate and the proposed regional operation against the ADF and other armed groups ultimately did not move forward.  The FARDC launched a unilateral operation against the ADF on October 31, 2019.')"

    "complete_EA_text = ('EAST ASIA AND THE PACIFICOverviewIn 2019, governments in East Asia and the Pacific continued working to strengthen legal frameworks, investigate and prosecute terrorism cases, increase regional cooperation and information sharing, and address critical border and aviation security gaps.  Regional cooperation between domestic law enforcement and judicial authorities among countries throughout Southeast Asia resulted in high numbers of terrorism-related arrests and, in many cases, successful prosecutions.On March 15, 2019, a gunman carried out and live-streamed a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Fifty-one people were killed, 50 more were injured, and the livestream was viewed around 4,000 times before being removed by technology companies.  Two months later, a group of government leaders and major online service providers adopted a non-binding pledge – the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online (Christchurch Call) – to prevent terrorist use of the internet.  The United States did not endorse the Christchurch Call due to policy and legal concerns, but it supports the overall goals and continues to work with international partners to counter the use of the internet for terrorist purposes.  This was illustrated by U.S. endorsement of the 2019 G20 Osaka Leaders’ Statement on Preventing Exploitation of the Internet for Terrorism and Violent Extremism and the 2019 G-7 Biarritz Strategy for an Open, Free and Secure Digital Transformation, among others.Multiple suicide bombings in the Philippines were a new phenomenon for the region.  They included a complex attack against a military unit in Sulu, which involved the first Filipino suicide bomber, as well as a suicide attack at the Jolo Cathedral in Sulu, carried out by an Indonesian couple.  Southeast Asian governments remained concerned about foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) returning from Iraq or Syria and using their operational skills, connections, and experience to launch domestic attacks.Authorities in East Asia and the Pacific actively participated in regional and international efforts to counter terrorism.  Australia, Fiji, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan are partners in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, and New Zealand are members of the GCTF.  As co-chairs of the GCTF Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Working Group, Australia and Indonesia organized an annual plenary meeting and workshops on monitoring, measuring, and evaluating CVE programs, CVE in prisons, and the role of gender and civil society organizations in CVE.Civil society organizations expressed concern that some governments in the region used terrorism as a pretext to target religious minorities and human rights activists.  The Chinese government’s repressive approach to counterterrorism disregards human rights and relies heavily on mass surveillance, censorship, and mass internment of religious and ethnic minorities.  China’s CT efforts continue to focus primarily on “extremists” whom Beijing ascribes to the so-called East Turkistan Islamic Movement, despite a lack of independent evidence that a group by that name is still active.  The Chinese government has detained more than one million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, using counterterrorism as a pretext.AustraliaOverview:  In 2019, Australia strengthened CT laws, investigated and disrupted suspected terrorist plots, and maintained high levels of cooperation with the United States and other international partners.  Australia played a major role in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and was a leading contributor to the Coalition’s military support, humanitarian assistance, and efforts to disrupt FTFs.  Australia was endorsed as a co-chair of the GCTF CVE Working Group for a second term from 2019-2021.  At the end of 2019, Australia’s National Terrorism Threat Advisory System remained at “Probable,” the third-highest level on a five-level scale.  The Australian Security Intelligence Organization’s 2019 annual report found that “Islamist extremism” remained the principal source of terrorist threat for Australia and reported an increase in REMT, which Australia calls “extreme right-wing terrorism,” in recent years.Australia remains committed to working with partner governments in Southeast Asia to shape a secure and prosperous region through greater cooperation on countering terrorism threats.  This includes bilateral engagements and supporting capability development and capacity-building activities across the region.  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) works with policing agencies in Southeast Asia and has facilitated a series of multilateral CT dialogues.Australia implemented legislation regarding FTFs returning to Australia.  Australian security agencies estimate that about 230 Australian citizens have traveled to Iraq and Syria since 2012.  The government estimates that about 80 Australians are currently in Syria/Iraq and have fought for or supported ISIS or similar groups.  Australian authorities are aware of 66 Australians in al-Hawl refugee camp in Syria.  Australia repatriated eight children from Syria in June.Since September 2014, Australian CT authorities have conducted 16 major counterterrorism disruption operations in response to potential or imminent attacks in Australia.  A further 98 people have been charged as a result of 44 counterterrorism-related operations around Australia.In 2019, Australia worked closely with the United States to identify and develop new capabilities that meet a wide variety of requirements for countering terrorist threats.  Through a cost-sharing bilateral relationship, both countries advanced their technical ability to defeat or mitigate the evolving capabilities of terrorists and criminal organizations.  The United States and Australia also worked closely on capacity-building efforts in Southeast Asia.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Australia experienced no terrorist-related attacks in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Australia continued to apply its comprehensive CT legislation against domestic threats and passed additional legislation aimed at addressing external threats.  In July 2019, the Australian Government implemented CT legislation to address the threat posed by returning terrorist fighters.  Australia introduced the Counter-Terrorism Bill 2019 (Temporary Exclusion Orders), which allows the prime minister to prevent an Australian citizen from reentering the country for up to two years if the person is suspected of supporting, or having fought with, a terrorist organization overseas.  In the aftermath of the Christchurch terrorist attacks in March, the Australian Parliament passed the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Act 2019, which came into force in April.  The Act adds new offenses to the criminal code concerning online “abhorrent violent” content – defined as murder or attempted murder, a terrorist act, torture, rape, or kidnapping.  Under the Act, it is an offense for an internet service provider, content service or hosting service to fail to refer to the AFP “within a reasonable time” (not defined in the Act) abhorrent violent material that the provider is aware could be accessed through or on its service, where the underlying conduct occurred or is occurring in Australia.New counterterror legislation – Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2019 – was introduced in September 2019.  The legislation stems from concerns that the current counterterror legislation does not cover several current high-risk offenders, including Australian fighters in Syria and several who have returned.  The Citizen Cessation Bill would give Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton new authority to strip dual-national terrorists of their Australian citizenship.  The legislation will broaden the number of individuals whom the government can investigate and prosecute for engaging in terror-related activities by backdating the current deadline from December 12, 2015, to May 29, 2003.Significant law enforcement actions in 2019 included the following:In July, Australian police arrested three men over an alleged ISIS-inspired plot to attack several Sydney targets.In December, Australia’s Federal Police arrested a 21-year-old man in Sydney on three separate terrorism charges.Australia’s border security remained robust and the country continued to promote international cooperation on information sharing to thwart terrorist travel.  Australian authorities are investigating 230 people in Australia for providing support to terrorist groups involved in the Syria/Iraq conflict.  Since 2012, around 250 Australian passports have been cancelled or applications refused in relation to the Syria/Iraq conflict.In September 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Traveler Branch/Customs Group of the Australian Border Force approved an annex to the Global Entry joint statement that outlines how Australia will vet Australian citizens for U.S. Global Entry membership and how approval information will be shared between Australia and CBP.  Australia is in the process of building the infrastructure to collect application information for Australian citizens.  The pilot, which will be limited to 500 Australians, is expected to launch in 2020.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Australia is a member of the FATF and co-chairs the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), Australia’s FIU, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Australia is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s Counter ISIS Finance Group (CIFG).  In November, Australia hosted the second “No Money for Terror” Ministerial Conference on Counter-Terrorism Financing, bringing together 65 delegations, including 23 ministers, representatives from 15 international bodies including the United Nations, FATF and FATF-style regional bodies, as well as representatives from 28 private sector and not-for-profit organizations.Countering Violent Extremism:  Australia’s CVE strategy remains focused on four overlapping streams that emphasize diversity and social participation, target work with vulnerable communities and institutions, address online terrorist propaganda, and assist diversion and de-radicalization.  Australia is active in the GCTF and co-chairs the GCTF CVE Working Group with Indonesia.  At the GCTF Coordinating Committee meeting in September, Australia announced that it would partner with Switzerland and the United Kingdom to create a policy toolkit on the Zurich-London Recommendations that outline good practices for CVE and terrorist recruitment online.  The Policy Toolkit on the Zurich-London Recommendations was launched in September 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Australia is a member of the UN, the GCTF, the Pacific Island Forum, the East Asia Summit, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  At the ninth Trilateral Strategic Dialogue, which convened in April 2019, Australia pledged to cooperate with the United States and Japan to enhance border management practices and strengthen information sharing.  In 2018, Australia signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ASEAN outlining cooperation on CT, including law enforcement cooperation, capacity building, and technical assistance.  Since signing the MOU with ASEAN, AUSTRAC has implemented a regional Financial Intelligence Analyst Course and a Multilateral Analyst Exchange Program.China (Hong Kong and Macau)ChinaOverview:  The People’s Republic of China (PRC) response to terrorism remained difficult to distinguish from the government’s suppression of peaceful activities that authorities deemed separatist or subversive in nature.  The PRC government’s CT attention remained on ethnic Uyghur so-called “extremists” whom Beijing ascribes to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, despite a lack of evidence that a group by that name is still active.  The PRC government shared international concerns regarding other terrorist groups such as al-Qa’ida and ISIS, among others.Using counterterrorism as a pretext, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has detained more than one million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region since April 2017.  Because of their religion and ethnicity, they reportedly have been subjected to political, linguistic, and cultural indoctrination as well as forced disappearance, torture, physical abuse – including forced sterilization and sexual abuse – and prolonged detention without trial.  Chinese authorities also developed new legal guidelines and law enforcement tools to expand their capabilities to carry out this repressive campaign, which included pervasive, arbitrary, high-tech surveillance; the collection of personal data including DNA samples; compulsory stays by PRC government officials in Uyghur homes; and controls on the expression of cultural or religious observations.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Details about alleged terrorism-related incidents inside China were difficult to verify due to a lack of transparency and information from PRC authorities.  PRC government officials provided few responses to requests from U.S. and other international officials for detailed information on alleged terrorist threats.  As in 2018, PRC officials continued to claim that no violent terrorist incidents have occurred in the country since 2016, owing to the government’s “new counter-extremism policies,” in an attempt to justify Beijing’s repressive campaign in Xinjiang.Chinese citizens abroad were targeted in terrorism-related incidents in 2019.  The Baloch Liberation Army continued to link concerns about Chinese activity in the Chinese Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to terrorist attacks in the region and claimed responsibility for an attack on a Chinese-frequented hotel in Gwadar in May.  Chinese citizens abroad were also impacted by other terrorist attacks not specifically directed against PRC government policies.  For example, two Chinese citizens were injured in a July attack in Somalia claimed by al-Shabaab.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In March, the State Council Information Office published a white paper: “The Fight Against Terrorism and Extremism and Human Rights Protection in Xinjiang,” which falsely claimed that the camps were in fact “vocational training and education centers” where detainees learned Mandarin Chinese, national laws, vocational skills, and ideas to counter “extremist” thinking.  International media reported on the continued mass transfer of Uyghurs and other Muslims to China’s interior due to overcrowding at camps in Xinjiang, on efforts to move some detainees to forced labor facilities, and on draconian detention conditions in the facilities, including torture and deaths.  Internal PRC government documents published by international media confirmed the coercive nature and prison-like conditions of the internment camps.  In August, Chinese media made public the creation of a CT special operations unit in the People’s Armed Police (PAP) operating in Xinjiang.  Media reports did not indicate when the unit was initially established, but said the unit had passed an evaluation process and was capable of conducting combat missions.In September, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi stressed the importance of intelligence collection and research, calling for strengthened early warning and precise strikes against terrorist activities, and implementation of real-name airline ticket purchases and security checks.  The PRC government continued to leverage its domestic technology sector to bolster its surveillance capabilities, including for alleged CT goals.  Police deepened use of closed-circuit television camera networks paired with facial recognition, iris scanning, and other technologies to track, discover, or predict threats to public safety across the country.  Although such technology has been used to catch criminal actors, it is also used to monitor and control domestic dissidents and ethnic and religious minorities.  The PRC government continued to stress the threat of domestic and international “cyber terrorism,” as a continuing pretext to tighten monitoring and censorship of online speech and mobile communications.  Next-generation “anti-terrorism” equipment, including assault vehicles and anti-riot vehicles, was displayed during the PRC 70th anniversary military parade in October.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  China is a member of the FATF, the APG, and the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (EAG).  The PRC is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.In April 2019, FATF published a Mutual Evaluation Report that reviewed the PRC’s compliance with FATF standards and the effectiveness of PRC’s AML/CFT system.  The report demonstrated a strong overall understanding of China’s terrorist financing risks, but noted deficiencies related to the implementation of targeted financial sanctions and understanding of terrorist financing risks among financial and non-financial institutions, businesses, and professions.  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) regularly cooperate on the topic of terrorist financing.Countering Violent Extremism:  The PRC government continued to implement repressive campaigns in Xinjiang under the guise of countering what it called “extremism.”  Authorities intensified a campaign of mass “re-education” or “vocational training” of Uyghurs and other Muslims, which began in April 2017 with the purported goal of countering “extremism,” but whose actual goal the United States assesses to be the repression of religious and ethnic minorities.  Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims are reportedly forced to learn Chinese, recite slogans in praise of the CCP, and renounce their culture and religion.  At a December 10, 2019, press conference, Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and CCP deputy chief in Xinjiang, announced that all “training” participants had “graduated” but noted the centers would remain open for local residents to participate in Chinese language, legal, vocational skills, and de-radicalization training.  The PRC government’s broad definitions of “terrorism” and “extremism” and its unclear definition of “cyber terrorism” continue to raise serious human rights concerns.Regional and International Cooperation:  The PRC government continued to promote the UN as the primary international forum for counterterrorism, where it actively promotes a repressive approach to counterterrorism.  In October, the UN Counterterrorism Executive Directorate conducted its first ever assessment of China’s implementation of international counterterrorism obligations.  The PRC engaged in a range of multilateral, regional, and bilateral fora, while seeking to present itself as a global leader on counterterrorism.  In March, former Vice Foreign Minister Cheng Guoping was appointed to a newly-created position as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs External Security Commissioner, with a mandate to enhance diplomatic outreach on CT-related topics.  In 2019, efforts under these frameworks included a joint border operation, exercises on preventing terrorist use of the internet, and a joint CT drill held in Russia.  BRICS meetings, including its fourth Counterterrorism Working Group meeting, reinforced the centrality of CT cooperation.  China continued to participate in the Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism for Counter Terrorism, along with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.  Representatives from 31 countries sent military and police representatives to attend the PAP’s biennial Great Wall International Forum on Counterterrorism.Units from the People’s Liberation Army and PAP also held bilateral CT drills with a range of countries including India, Kazakhstan, Russia, Singapore, and Tajikistan, and in July Beijing held high-level talks with Pakistan on how to strengthen CT cooperation to protect CPEC projects.  China is a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum, APEC, and the East Asia Summit, and it is also a member of the GCTF.  The PRC government hosted 800 officers from ASEAN and dialogue countries for their largest-ever CT exercise in November.Hong KongOverview:  Hong Kong continued its security and law enforcement partnership with the United States through the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department’s joint implementation of the Container Security Initiative.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  No terrorist incidents were reported in Hong Kong in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Counterterrorism remained an operational priority for the Hong Kong Police Force.  The Police Counterterrorism Response Unit provides a strong deterrent presence, assisting police districts with CT strategy implementation and complementing the tactical and professional support of existing police specialist units such as the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau, the Special Duties Unit, the Airport Security Unit, and the VIP Protection Unit.In 2018, the Hong Kong government set up the Inter-Departmental Counterterrorism Unit (IDCU) to strengthen overall CT efforts by monitoring global trends, reviewing, and improving CT strategies in Hong Kong, developing specialized CT training, and optimizing emergency response plans.  The IDCU held its first exercise in March.In 2019, authorities in Hong Kong falsely characterized the acts of pro-democracy and human rights protestors as terrorism.  The PRC spokesman in Hong Kong also falsely described the actions of protestors as showing “signs of terrorism.”Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Hong Kong is a member of the FATF and the APG.  Hong Kong’s FIU, the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.In September, the FATF published a Mutual Evaluation Report of Hong Kong, assessing Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regime to be compliant and effective overall.  The report assessed Hong Kong to be at medium-low risk of terrorist financing and assessed that it has implemented sound systems to detect and investigate terrorist financing when it occurs.  It further states that authorities demonstrated “a robust use of financial intelligence and the capacity to conduct complex CFT investigations,” although these have not yet exposed proliferation financing cases.In November 2019, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority hosted Hong Kong’s AML/CFT regulatory technology forum, discussing with participants from banks, financial regulators, and law enforcement agencies the use of innovative technology to enhance the efficiency of its AML/CFT ecosystem.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes to Hong Kong’s CVE programming in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Hong Kong law enforcement officers attended U.S. government-sponsored capacity building training at the International Law Enforcement Academy on personnel and facility security, law enforcement techniques to counter terrorism, and financial investigations.  In January 2019, Hong Kong’s representatives joined a tripartite meeting among mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau to foster cooperation on AML/CFT.  Hong Kong is also an APEC economy.MacauOverview:  Macau’s CT cooperation with the United States included information sharing.  The Police Intervention Tactical Unit (UTIP), which falls under the Macau Public Security Police Force, is responsible for protecting important installations and dignitaries, and conducting high-risk missions, such as improvised explosive device deactivation.  UTIP’s Special Operations Group’s mission is CT operations.  Macau cooperated internationally on CT efforts through INTERPOL and other security-focused organizations.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  No terrorist incidents were reported in Macau in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  As a gambling center, Macau authorities are aware of the risks associated with junket promoters.  They have indicated they are working on further steps, including strengthening the regulatory framework for market entry and intensifying AML/CFT oversight.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Macau is a member of APG.  Macau’s FIU, the Financial Intelligence Office (FIO), is a member of the Egmont Group.  In October, the APG announced that Macau became the first member among the globally evaluated members to demonstrate compliance with all 40 FATF recommendations.In January and February, supervisory agencies – including the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, the Finance Services Bureau, the Macau Monetary Authority, and the Housing Bureau – updated their AML/CFT guidelines to reduce the risk of money laundering and financing of terrorism.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes to Macau’s CVE programming in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  In 2019, the FIO signed separate memoranda of understanding/cooperation for exchange of AML/CFT intelligence with counterparts in the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Federative Republic of Brazil.  In January, the FIO hosted a tripartite meeting among mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau to strengthen cooperation on AML/CFT.  In September, the FIO visited the AML Bureau of the People’s Bank of China and the China Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center to further strengthen cooperation and exchange.IndonesiaOverview:  Indonesia applied sustained pressure to detect, disrupt, and degrade terrorist groups operating within its borders and deny them safe haven.  ISIS-affiliated Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) and its offshoots continued to target police and other symbols of state authority.  While not a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the Indonesian government and Muslim civil society leaders forcefully and repeatedly denounced ISIS and actively promoted the importance of CVE efforts to complement law enforcement CT efforts.  Indonesia is an active member of GCTF and co-chairs the CVE Working Group with Australia.  The Indonesian, Malaysian, and Philippines’ militaries continued coordinated patrols in the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas to deter and prevent kidnapping and terrorist transit in their adjoining exclusive economic zones.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  JAD-affiliated cells and ISIS-inspired lone actors continued to target the police and other government targets:On March 12, the wife of a suspected terrorist detonated a bomb, killing herself and her child after refusing to surrender to police in Sibolga.On October 10, two ISIS-inspired attackers, a husband and wife, severely wounded Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs Wiranto and a policeman in a stabbing attack in Pandeglang.On November 13, a 24-year old JAD cell member disguised as a motorcycle taxi driver detonated a bomb vest on the police headquarters compound in Medan, killing himself and wounding four police personnel and two civilians.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Government of Indonesia issued Regulation No. 77/2019 on the Prevention of Terrorism and Protection of Investigators, Public Prosecutors, Judges and Correctional Officers as an implementing regulation under the 2018 Law on Terrorism on November 13.  The regulation tasks the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) with preventing terrorism through national preparedness and counterterrorism radicalization and de-radicalization programs.  The regulation also provides protection for investigators, public prosecutors, judges, and corrections officers and their families.From January to December, police arrested approximately 296 terror suspects and killed at least six for resisting arrest.  Among those arrested was Para Wijayanto, the suspected leader of al‑Qa’ida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah, for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings and other attacks.  Indonesia convicted two terror suspects; 42 remain on trial.  Additionally in July, the National Police confirmed that an Indonesian couple, Rullie Rian Zeke and his wife, Ulfah Handayani Saleh, were behind the January 27 Jolo Cathedral bombing in the Philippines.  The East Jakarta District Court sentenced to death JAD member Suherman on October 9, the first terrorist defendant convicted under the 2018 terrorism law, making him the fourth convicted terrorist on death row.  Indonesia last executed convicted terrorists in 2008.In July, the Indonesian military launched an elite unit – Special Operations Command – to help fight terrorism in the country.The Government of Indonesia inaugurated a super-maximum-security prison for high-risk convicted terrorists on Nusa Kambangan Island in Central Java on August 22.  The Government of Indonesia coordinated and socialized a plan to relocate selected terrorist inmates to the BNPT De-radicalization Center (Pusderad) in Sentul to provide a structured, systematic, focused, and sustainable de-radicalization program in one location.Border security remained a challenge.  The Customs and Excise Directorate General, which collects API/PNR data to screen travelers, continued to experience difficulties with passenger targeting, analysis, management systems, and high-level management turnover.  Police maintained a watchlist of suspected terrorists, but lines of communication and coordination among stakeholder agencies were not always clear.  Indonesia’s Immigration Directorate General uses INTERPOL databases to screen international passengers at key immigration checkpoints in airports and seaports but must rely on the Customs Excise Directorate General for access to API/PNR.Indonesia hosted the trilateral joint exercise Indomalphi Middle Land Exercise 2019 in Tarakan, North Kalimantan, from July 29 to August 7 as a follow-up to the Sulu trilateral coordinated sea and air patrols launched in June and October 2017 under the Trilateral Cooperative Agreement.  This land exercise involved 160 army soldiers from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, as well as observers from Singapore and Brunei.  The exercise aimed to improve border cooperation among the three countries in fighting terrorism and other transnational crimes in the maritime domain.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Indonesia is a member of the APG.  Indonesia’s FIU, the Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Indonesia acquired observer status in FATF in 2018 and is on track toward full membership by 2020.  Indonesia is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  In 2019, Indonesia prosecuted and convicted individuals for financing terrorism.Countering Violent Extremism:  BNPT continued its work on a draft CVE national action plan for anticipated release as a presidential executive order.  BNPT also managed de-radicalization programs for terrorist convicts.  Indonesians deported from third countries for attempted travel to Iraq and Syria were enrolled in a one-month de-radicalization program at a rehabilitation shelter operated by the Ministry of Social Affairs in Bambu Apus, East Jakarta.  BNPT used former terrorists for CVE outreach campaigns and helped establish boarding schools to educate children of former terrorists.  Indonesia issued a Ministerial Joint Decree on Handling Radicalism among Civil Servants on November 12 and formed a dedicated task force to monitor, investigate, and report online behavior of civil servants accused of “radicalism.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Indonesia continued to support CT efforts in several regional and multilateral organizations, including the UN, ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and APEC.  Indonesia remained active in the ARF Inter-Sessional Meetings on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime and the APEC Counter-Terrorism Working Group.  Indonesia hosted the U.S./ASEAN Workshop on Developing National Action Plans on CVE August 5-6.  Indonesia continued to use the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation as a regional training center.  Indonesia is a member of the GCTF and co-chairs the GCTF CVE Working Group with Australia.  Indonesia hosted the GCTF’s CVE Working Group Workshop on Counter and Alternative Narratives in Jakarta on June 24-25.MalaysiaOverview:  Although there were no ISIS-affiliated attacks in Malaysia in 2019, the country remained a source, a transit point, and, to a lesser extent, destination country for terrorist groups including ISIS, Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), al-Qa’ida, and Jemaah Islamiyah.  Suspected ISIS supporters deported from Turkey and individuals linked to ISIS or ASG planning to travel to the southern Philippines used Malaysia as a transit point.  Malaysia monitored, arrested, deported, and tried suspected supporters of terrorist groups.  Malaysia also cooperated with the United States and others to increase border security capacity at airports and in the Sulu Sea, CT messaging on social media, and to improve terrorist prosecutions.  Malaysia is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  While no ISIS-affiliated attacks were carried out in 2019, Malaysia remained a transit point and hub for kidnap-for-ransom activities perpetrated by other terrorist networks.  On June 18, 10 fishermen were kidnapped off the coast of Lahad Datu in Sabah state by ASG militants.  The victims were later rescued and released without harm.  On September 4, two armed men believed to be on the lookout for potential kidnap victims or with plans to commit violent acts were killed by local police in Sabah waters.  The Eastern Sabah Security Command (known as ESSCOM) announced the security commission was on “high-alert” following the September 23 kidnapping of three Indonesian fishermen and learning that ASG insurgents planned to carry out raids for ransom victims in the East Sabah area.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) conducted an internal review of the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA) to consider amending provisions assessed to be draconian or against human rights, according to media reports.  The MOHA minister said Malaysian security agencies engaged with civil society organizations, including the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, to receive input on the law.  Malaysian officials contend that SOSMA remains a critical element to fight terrorism and proposed reducing the allowed detention without charge time from 28 to 14 days.  However, no legislative amendments to SOSMA or security related laws – such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), the Sedition Act, or the Prevention of Crime Act – were announced by year’s end.The Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) Special Branch Counterterrorism Unit has the lead CT law enforcement role.  This unit identifies terrorist threats and reported several arrests during the year to prevent planned terrorist attacks.  In March, RMP reported the arrests of nine suspects, including six Egyptians and two Tunisians, for suspicion of plans to launch large scale attacks in several countries.  The RMP Special Branch Department made the arrests after receiving a tip from intelligence agencies about the presence of suspected terrorist fighters in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Sarawak.  From July to September, law enforcement reported the arrest of 16 suspects nationwide, which included 12 Indonesians, three Malaysians, and an Indian.  The suspects were accused of attempting to establish an ISIS cell in Malaysia and plan attacks in Malaysia and Indonesia.  In May, RMP Special Branch announced they foiled a wave of large-scale terror attacks and assassinations plotted by an ISIS-linked cell during the first week of Ramadan.  Four suspects were arrested during a sting operation on suspicion of planning attacks against religious sites and entertainment venues, the leader of which was charged with terrorism-related offenses.Convicted Malaysian terrorist Yazid Sufaat, who was linked to the September 11, 2001, attack in the United States, was released from prison on November 20, 2019.  Sufaat has served three separate prison sentences since 2001.  In 2017, he was detained under POTA law and released following the expiration of his two-year detention without trial.  RMP reports that Sufaat is under strict surveillance; he must wear an electronic monitoring device and report to the police twice a week.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Malaysia is a member of FATF and APG.  Malaysia’s FIU, Financial Intelligence Unit – Malaysia, is a member of the Egmont Group.  In October, the government approved legislation establishing the National Anti-Financial Crime Centre (NAFCC) to coordinate financial crime investigations.  The NAFCC is intended to direct efforts among Malaysia’s enforcement agencies in foreign and domestic financial crime investigations.  The NAFCC will house a centralized financial crime data system and include an executive committee that will approve and monitor integrated operations.  On November 5, the government launched the MyFINet initiative involving Bank Negara Malaysia, the Royal Malaysian Police, the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the Securities Commission Malaysia, and 18 reporting institutions.  The purpose of MyFINet is to facilitate financial intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies and reporting institutions to better detect and disrupt terrorism financing and financial crimes.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counter-Terrorism (SEARCCT) launched a number of CVE initiatives, which included counter-messaging programs shared through social media and radio as well as onsite workshops targeting youth.  Within the year, SEARCCT organized a nationwide youth program on “Building Community Resilience” and partnered with Deakin University in Australia to strengthen engagement between government and civil society organizations across Southeast Asia.  SEARCCT also collaborated with the Ministry of Home Affairs Prison Department to produce a series of interviews with former and current detainees charged with terrorism-related offenses to raise awareness on recruitment practices and narratives of terrorist organizations.International and Regional Cooperation:  Malaysia continued to support CT efforts in regional and multilateral organizations.  The Government of Malaysia hosted the May 2019 Global Counterterrorism Workshop under the Terrorist Travel Initiative and the first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) workshop on aviation security and UNSCR 2396 in July 2019.  Malaysian officials participated in numerous CT events hosted by the UN, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, ASEAN, the ASEAN ARF, APEC, and the East Asia Summit.PhilippinesOverview:  The Philippine government adapted its military, law enforcement, and counter-radicalization efforts to address shifting threats from terrorist groups that continued to operate primarily in the country’s South.  The Philippines continued to cooperate with the United States, notably enhancing law enforcement and other efforts to address the full spectrum of terrorist threats.  Philippine military, law enforcement, and judicial authorities participated in numerous U.S. capacity-building programs, and used the training and equipment they received to prevent and respond to terrorist incidents.Groups affiliated with ISIS-Philippines continued efforts to recover from battlefield losses, recruiting and training new members, and staging suicide bombings and attacks with IEDs and small arms that targeted security forces and civilians.  ISIS-Philippines affiliates active in 2019 included elements of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), Ansar al-Khalifa Philippines (AKP), and the Maute Group.  The Philippines remained a destination for FTFs from Indonesia, Malaysia, and countries in the Middle East and Europe.The Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) made progress toward a political settlement of long-running insurgencies.  In January, residents of the region passed a referendum to ratify the Bangsamoro Organic Law to implement the national government’s peace agreement with the MILF.  Ratification of the law established a new, more autonomous regional government led by the MILF in February.  However, some rogue MILF elements and breakaway groups, including BIFF, ASG, AKP, and the Maute Group, continued to oppose the peace process.  The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) continued attacks on security forces and civilians, and the government sustained military and law enforcement operations against the group.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorists continued to target civilians and security forces with IEDs and small arms, and the emergence of suicide bombings posed new challenges for Philippine security forces.An Indonesian couple carried out a complex suicide attack during Mass at the Jolo Cathedral in Sulu on January 27, killing 23 people and wounding 102.  Philippine officials linked the plot to the ASG and ISIS, both of which claimed responsibility for the bombing.In Sultan Kudarat, the BIFF was implicated in IED attacks on civilian targets that wounded dozens, and a foiled IED attack at a Catholic chapel.Two men, including the first Filipino implicated in a suicide bombing, carried out a complex suicide attack against a military unit deployed to combat the ASG in Sulu on June 28, killing eight and wounding at least 20.A woman conducted a suicide attack at the entrance to a military camp in Sulu on September 8.Security forces thwarted an apparent suicide bombing plot in a November 5 firefight in Sulu, recovering suicide vests from two FTFs killed in the encounter.  Terrorist groups abducted Filipino, Malaysian, Indonesian, and British victims.Two British citizens were kidnapped in Zamboanga del Sur on October 4 by armed men the government later said were members of ASG.  The victims were recovered on November 25 in Sulu following military operations in the area.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The country’s main CT legislation includes the 2007 Human Security Act (HSA) and the 2012 Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act (TF Law).  Proposed amendments to strengthen the HSA by covering preparatory acts and reducing administrative hurdles to terrorism prosecutions remained pending in Congress at the end of 2019.  The Philippine government published a list of groups designated as terrorist organizations that included ISIS East Asia and the CPP/NPA.  Investments in personnel and training for the Philippine National Police Special Action Force and other specialized law enforcement units improved the government’s capacity to detect, deter, and prevent terrorist acts.  The government continued law enforcement and judicial responses to terrorism, disrupting plots and investigating and prosecuting terrorists.  A regional trial court convicted a Maute Group sniper for violating the Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law.The Philippine government made progress toward compliance with UNSCR 2396, taking steps to curb terrorist travel and improving information sharing with foreign partners.  The Bureau of Immigration (BI) used deportation and exclusion to remove several FTFs.  Although the BI screened against domestic and INTERPOL watchlists at ports of entry, additional capacity is needed to collect API/PNR.  The government worked with INTERPOL to enhance collection and reporting of lost and stolen passport information.  The Philippines improved aviation security through closer collaboration with foreign partners, with enhanced screening technologies and training, and with strengthened oversight programs and information sharing.The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued a public notice in December 2018 alerting travelers of deficiencies at Manila International Airport.  The government implemented improvements, and TSA rescinded the notice in August 2019 after a follow-up assessment showed the airport is now adequately implementing international security standards and recommended practices established by ICAO.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The Philippines is a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), a FATF-style regional body.  Its FIU, the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), is a member of the Egmont Group.  The October APG Mutual Evaluation Report noted improvements in technical compliance since 2009, as well as vulnerabilities in light of the Philippines’ continued high terrorism-finance-risk profile and mature support networks that sustain terrorist groups.  The AMLC announced in November that it had seized $1 million from terrorism suspects; however, legislative and procedural hurdles continued to impede efforts to prevent, investigate, and prosecute money laundering and terrorism finance.  In May, prosecutors used the TF Law to file charges against a suspect for support to the ASG.  AMLC increased CFT cooperation with international partners.  The Joint Terrorism Financial Investigations Group continued to work with the United States to investigate terrorism finance cases.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Philippines finalized a National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism and developed and implemented CVE training for security forces and civil servants.  Local governments, NGOs, and the private sector partnered on CVE programs.  The Philippines established a Country Support Mechanism to coordinate GCERF funding for CVE programs.  The Armed Forces of the Philippines worked with local stakeholders to encourage defections from the ASG, BIFF, and the Maute Group, and to rehabilitate former fighters.  The Philippine government also supported strategic communications efforts to counter terrorist messaging.International and Regional Cooperation:  The Philippine Navy continued joint patrols with its Indonesian and Malaysian counterparts under a June 2017 trilateral arrangement to combat piracy, terrorism, and the illegal drug trade.  Official law enforcement coordination under this mechanism is limited, although the relevant agencies collaborate at the operational level.  The Philippines continues to support CT efforts as a member of ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and APEC.SingaporeOverview:  Singapore continued to identify counterterrorism as the nation’s top security policy priority and developed a comprehensive CT strategy based on global and regional trends.  This strategy included vigilant security measures, regional and international law enforcement cooperation, counter-radicalization efforts, and a campaign to prepare the populace for possible attacks.  Singapore was a committed, active, and effective CT partner in 2019.  Counterterrorism remained a pillar of the security relationship between Singaporean and U.S. law enforcement and security services.  The levels of cooperation on CT efforts and information sharing remained steady in 2019.  Singapore’s domestic CT apparatus and its ability to detect, deter, and disrupt threats remained effective.  Singapore is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents in Singapore in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Singapore uses its Internal Security Act (ISA) to arrest and detain suspected terrorists.  The ISA authorizes the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), with the consent of the president, to order arrests and detentions without warrants, if it is determined that individuals pose a threat to national security.  The initial detention may be for up to two years, and the MHA may renew detention orders for an unlimited period (in increments of up to two years at a time), with the president’s consent.  Alternatively, the government can issue a restriction order limiting a person’s international travel and changes of residence or employment without government approval.  ISA cases are subject to review by the courts to ensure strict compliance with procedural requirements under the act.  Singapore’s existing legal framework, in conjunction with the ISA, provides the government the necessary tools to support the investigation and prosecution of terrorism offenses.Singapore detained numerous individuals under the ISA for terrorism-related activities in 2019, including a Singaporean who was an alleged supporter of Sri Lankan radical preacher Zahran Hashim, identified by the Sri Lankan authorities as the mastermind of the April 21 terrorist attack in Colombo.  Singapore issued detention orders against foreign domestic workers for the first time in 2019, detaining three Indonesian women in September while investigating their terrorism financing activities.  Singapore released at least four individuals who were being detained under the ISA after assessing their rehabilitation progress and determining that the individuals no longer posed a security threat that required preventive detention.Singapore maintains a “not if, but when” stance regarding the likelihood of terrorist attacks within the city-state.  The government’s SGSecure public awareness campaign, started in 2016 to improve emergency preparedness, promote security awareness, and build national resiliency, launched a “SGSecure Roadshow” program in August to bring interactive and informational tools on emergency preparedness directly to communities.  Roadshows will be held in shopping malls and town centers throughout the country.  The Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defense Force continued regular CT exercises in 2019, including conducting simulated terrorist attacks in a place of worship and a concert setting for the first time.  The MHA launched the Home Team Science and Technology Agency in December with a mandate to develop science and technology capabilities to enhance Singapore’s ability to address emerging threats and evolving challenges on the security landscape.To better detect possible terrorist movements by air into or transiting through the country, Singapore’s primary border security agency, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, is working to improve its passenger screening system by integrating API/PNR data transmitted from air carriers into its border screening processes.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Singapore has maintained an Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Industry Partnership (ACIP) since 2017.  The ACIP is a joint initiative between the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force, with the goal of bringing together relevant government agencies and private-sector participants to strengthen Singapore’s capabilities to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  In April, Singapore’s “Serious Crimes and Counter-Terrorism (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act” went into effect, strengthening AML and CFT frameworks.  The law updated the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act to expand the scope of prohibited activities to include financing travel for terrorist training and increase penalties for terrorism financing.  The law also allowed Singapore’s FIU, the Suspicious Transaction Report Office, to exchange financial intelligence with FIUs in a broader range of overseas jurisdictions.  Singapore convicted and sentenced the first Singaporean national under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act in October.  The accused was sentenced to 30 months in jail for providing approximately $1,000 to an individual overseas who was facilitating terrorist acts.Countering Violent Extremism:  Through entities such as the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research (ICPVTR) and the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG), Singapore serves as a regional CVE hub.  The ICPVTR conducts research, training, and outreach programs aimed at understanding the causes of “extremism” and formulating practical rehabilitation programs.  The government also encourages inter-religious and inter-ethnic dialogue through Interracial and Religious Confidence Circles and the inter-agency Aftercare Group, local community fora that bring leaders from Singapore’s religious and ethnic communities together to discuss issues of concern and build trust.The government believes in building regional CVE capacity, and has highlighted opportunities for constructive engagement for those concerned with the conflict in Syria and Iraq, such as promoting legitimate charities working to ease suffering in conflict zones.  The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), the Islamic authority in charge of Muslim affairs, maintains a Facebook presence and holds outreach and educational events to counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment efforts.  MUIS manages the Asatizah Recognition Scheme that vets Islamic Religious Council teachers and scholars in Singapore.Singapore’s RRG, a volunteer organization made up of Islamic scholars and teachers, has had success in counseling detainees held under the ISA.  The comprehensive program includes religious and psychological counseling and involves the detainee’s family and community.  The RRG also operated a resource and counseling center for the Muslim community and held community events, such as a documentary screening and dialogue with foreign domestic workers in Singapore, to discuss religious concepts and indicators of radicalization.International and Regional Cooperation:  Singapore is an active participant in CT cooperation efforts in ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and APEC.  Singapore is a strong advocate for the ASEAN “Our Eyes” regional initiative, which strives for ministerial-level CT information sharing.  Singapore remains interested in improving regional CT information sharing at the operational level as well.  In October, Singapore and Jordan co-hosted the “Aqaba Process” Southeast Asia Expert-Level Meeting.  Singapore attended the Fifth Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) Summit 2019 held in November 2019 in Manila, Philippines, and contributes actively to a number of information sharing projects under the CTF Summit’s South East Asia Counter-Terrorism Financing Working Group.ThailandOverview:  Thailand experienced no attacks attributed to transnational terrorist groups in 2019 and violence was restricted to attacks attributed to ethno-nationalist insurgents in the country’s restive southern region.  The number of terrorist incidents in the Deep South (the southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and parts of Songkhla) in 2019 was the lowest since the conflict reignited in 2004.  Thai security officials remain concerned about the potential for ISIS to infiltrate domestic insurgent groups, although they have maintained that there is no evidence to date of any operational linkages between these domestic groups and international terrorism networks.  Thailand’s principal vulnerability to international terrorism continues to be as a transit and facilitation hub, given the high volume of travelers through Bangkok’s main airport and available market of illegal goods.  Thailand remained a productive CT partner, though the Thai government continues to focus on domestic political challenges as its primary security priority.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Overall, the number of insurgent terrorist attacks and related fatalities decreased from the previous year; however, a November 5 attack at a security checkpoint in Yala killed 15, making it the single deadliest attack attributed to southern insurgents since 2004.  Attacks in 2019 were primarily confined to Thailand’s southernmost provinces, although a set of coordinated small-scale explosions in Bangkok in August is widely believed to be linked to the Deep South insurgency.  Terrorist methods primarily included shootings, arson, IEDs, and VBIEDs.In January, a spate of terrorist attacks took place, including a car bomb outside a security base in Songkhla Province that wounded two police officers, the shooting death of four defense volunteers guarding a school in Pattani Province, and an attack on a police station in Narathiwat Province that killed one police officer.On January 18, two Buddhist monks were killed in an insurgent attack in Narathiwat Province, the first monks killed in an insurgent attack in three years.  The attack followed the killing of three imams by unknown assailants in the preceding two months.During March 9-10, a series of homemade pipe bombs exploded in the southern provinces of Satun and Phattalung but they caused no deaths or injuries.  Both provinces border the Deep South, but neither has a history of insurgent-related activity.On May 26, a bomb attack on a railway station in Songkhla Province killed one police officer and injured three others.On May 27, at least two people died and nine were injured when a motorcycle bomb exploded at a flea market in Pattani Province.On August 2, a series of coordinated small-scale explosions took place across Bangkok as the city hosted more than 30 Foreign Ministers for the ASEAN Ministerial and related meetings.  The small improvised bombs caused no severe injuries or damage.  Although there has been no official attribution or claim of responsibility, most Deep South experts claim it was likely linked to the insurgency.  Three suspects were arraigned in November on 11 charges related to the August bombings in Bangkok, including terrorism.  The case is currently in pre-trial examination and the trial is scheduled to start in September 2020.On November 5, 15 people were killed and another four wounded in a late-night attack at a checkpoint in Yala Province targeting police, government officials, and local security volunteers in what was the deadliest attack since violence resurfaced in 2004.  An estimated 10 to 20 assailants used small arms and bombs in the attack.  Although no group claimed responsibility, the attack has been attributed to the Barisan Revolusi Nasional separatist group.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Thailand is in the process of drafting a new Counterterrorism Act, which aims to integrate existing terrorism-related laws into one document.  Thailand continues to apply the 2017-2021 National Counterterrorism Strategy for the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks, but details of the strategy have not been made public.  Under the strategy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains plans for collaboration with foreign governments.Thailand’s law enforcement authorities demonstrated some capacity to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist incidents.  Multiple entities including the Royal Thai Police, the Department of Special Investigation, and components of the Thai military have law enforcement responsibilities on CT cases.  Interagency cooperation and coordination were sporadic, information sharing was limited, and the delineation of duties between law enforcement and military units with CT responsibilities was unclear.Thailand’s borders are relatively porous, and information sharing within Thailand and with neighboring countries is limited.  The market in fraudulent documents remained active despite government efforts to crack down on criminal counterfeit networks.  Beginning in 2016, Thailand began to collect and analyze API/PNR data on commercial flights at all international airports.  As of late 2018, Thailand’s immigration system is reported to be real-time connected with INTERPOL’s Stolen and Lost Travel Document Database.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Thailand belongs to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, a FATF-style regional body.  Thailand’s FIU, the Anti-Money Laundering Office, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The national CT strategy published in 2017 includes a CVE component.  Thailand lacks a national CVE action plan, but the National Security Policy and Plan (2019-2022) published in November 2019 includes regionally specific security plans that focus on “extremism.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Thailand is a member of ASEAN, EAS, ARF, and APEC, and participated in international CT efforts, including through ASEAN, APEC, and ARF.')"

    "complete_EU_text = ('EUROPEOverviewEurope continued to face many ongoing terrorist threats and concerns in 2019, including from U.S.-designated FTOs, FTFs returning from Iraq and Syria, homegrown terrorists, and Iran-backed terrorists.  Despite the total loss of its geographic territory, ISIS continued to project its influence by fomenting attacks against symbolic European targets and public spaces, and recruiting from European countries.  Most of these incidents occurred in Western Europe and Russia and involved simple plots with easily executable tactics, such as the use of common tools and vehicles to injure or kill pedestrians.Many FTFs from Europe remained in the custody of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria at the end of 2019.  The United States urged European and other countries to bring back their citizens and prosecute, rehabilitate, and reintegrate them as appropriate, as the United States has done.  However, with the notable exceptions of Ireland and Italy, Western European governments generally refused to repatriate and prosecute their citizens, despite having extensive resources and well developed judicial systems.  A number of Western European countries revoked the citizenship of certain citizens who traveled to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS.  Countries in southeast Europe, including Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, successfully repatriated numerous ISIS-affiliated citizens, including FTFs.  The SDF lacks the resources, capacity, and support to detain ISIS fighters and family members for the long term.In Turkey, terrorist groups espousing a range of extremist and nationalist ideologies, such as the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party/Front, continued to plot against police and military targets in Turkey and raise funds throughout the rest of Europe.  Many European countries also saw a rise in racially or ethnically motivated terrorist (REMT) activity and plotting, including against religious and other minorities.Several European countries took concrete steps to combat Iranian regime-backed terrorism in 2019.  Albania, Denmark, and France all reduced diplomatic relations in response to Iran-backed plots to conduct assassinations or bombings in those countries.  These plots in the heart of Europe illustrate the global reach of Tehran’s terrorist capabilities.  In response to Iran’s terrorist plotting in Europe, the United States in 2019 launched the Countering Transnational Terrorism Forum (CTTF), bringing together law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and financial practitioners from more than 25 countries to disrupt Iranian terrorist activities and networks.  Numerous European nations also continued to participate in the U.S.-Europol Law Enforcement Coordination Group (LECG) to counter Hizballah’s terrorist and illicit activities around the world.  The LECG met twice in 2019.Many European governments are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by REMT.  A deadly October 2019 attempted attack targeting a synagogue in Halle, Germany, demonstrated the continued danger posed by REMT actors who exploit the internet and social media to spread violent propaganda.  A number of European governments expanded law enforcement and other government efforts to combat the threat posed by REMT individuals and groups.European countries were integral to worldwide counterterrorism efforts in 2019.  Thirty-nine European countries, the EU, INTERPOL, and NATO were active in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  In December, NATO Allies endorsed an update to the NATO Counterterrorism Action Plan, which includes efforts to increase resilience, expand cooperation with NATO partners and international organizations, and improve information sharing.  The Counterterrorism Action Plan continues to support the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and NATO Mission Iraq.Albania continued its strong support of international CT efforts in 2019 and contributed to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  The terrorism threat in Albania consists of FTFs returning from Iraq and Syria, Albanian youth being radicalized to terrorism, and Iran’s plotting against the resettled Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK).2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Albania in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Albania has criminalized terrorist acts, the financing of terrorism, conducting transactions with persons on UN sanctions lists, recruiting and training people to commit terrorist acts, the incitement of terrorist acts, and establishing, leading, and participating in terrorist organizations or armed conflicts outside the country.  Albania sustains a port security oversight system to comply with requirements under the International Maritime Organization’s International Ship and Port Facility Security Code.Albanian law enforcement increased efforts to counter potential terrorist threats.  The Albanian State Police Counterterrorism Unit (CTU) worked closely with U.S. agencies to align Albanian government requirements with U.S. expertise and resources, ensuring the Albanian government develops focused CT capabilities.  The CTU also participated in several successful interdictions of known or suspected terrorists.  In 2019, the CTU created a small sub-unit focused on countering terrorism financing.  The Albanian government has developed, in conjunction with international partners, contingency plans and capabilities to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against soft targets.  On October 23, the Albanian State Police announced it had foiled attacks planned in 2018 by Iranian agents against MEK members living in Albania.Corruption and barriers to information sharing among government agencies, insufficient intra-agency coordination, and a poorly functioning judicial system continued to hinder Albania’s law enforcement efforts at all levels.  Implementation of deep reforms in the judicial sector continues, beginning with the vetting of Albania’s 800 judges and prosecutors for corruption, incompetence, and ties to organized crime.  Once Albania establishes the Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Structure (SPAK), jurisdiction over terrorism cases involving an organized group will fall under the SPAK’s purview.  District prosecution offices will prosecute all other CT cases.Albania continues to take steps to enhance its border security, to detect and deny entry to terrorists, and comply with UNSCR 2396 standards such as the use of API/PNR to improve screening of air passengers.  Law enforcement services cooperate extensively with INTERPOL and other international law enforcement bodies.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Albania is a member of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL), a FATF-style regional body.  Its FIU, the General Directorate for the Prevention of Money Laundering, is a member of the Egmont Group.In 2019, Albania continued to work with FATF and MONEYVAL to address identified weaknesses in its AML/CFT regime.  A July 2018 MONEYVAL evaluation reported that Albania had “low effectiveness” in three immediate outcome areas:  confiscation, terrorist finance investigation and prosecution, and proliferation finance sanctions.  In June 2019, Albania enacted legislation to address these concerns, but actual implementation hinges on further regulations and action by the government.Also in 2019, the OSCE and UNODC jointly held a train-the-trainer course on countering terrorist financing for participants from Albania.  The course was part of a multi-annual OSCE-UNODC capacity-building program to support national efforts to counter terrorist financing in South-Eastern Europe, in accordance with UN Security Resolution 2462, FATF standards, and OSCE commitments.  Countering Violent Extremism:  The Government of Albania’s National CVE Center remains active in coordinating CVE programming among international donors and seeks to ensure all ministries cooperate effectively and avoid duplication of effort.  The Albanian cities of Cerrik, Elbasan, Librazhd, and Tirana are members of the Strong Cities Network (SCN).  The Albanian State Police have incorporated countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment into the portfolios of 26 community police units around the country.  The chiefs of these units received training from the U.S. government and implemented projects with local government counterparts to detect and counter terrorist radicalization efforts.International and Regional Cooperation:  Albania is a member of the Adriatic Charter, the Council of Europe (CoE), NATO, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the OSCE, the Regional Cooperation Council for Southeast Europe, and the UN.  Albanian criminal-justice officials participated regularly in various regional associations, conferences, and other CT information-sharing exchanges.U.S.-Austrian law enforcement cooperation remained strong.  Parliament ended its ad-hoc probe of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT), Austria’s key counterterrorism agency within the Ministry of the Interior.  The parliamentary inquiry exposed internal weaknesses and the need for restructuring, which an independent commission began in August 2019.  Austria’s CT efforts focused on “Islamist extremism,” the potential for homegrown terrorism by “lone actors,” and REMT groups promoting anti-Muslim and anti-migrant violence (which Austria refers to as “New Right” groups).  Austrian courts continued to impose strong sentences for convicted Islamist terrorists.  Austria expanded its national action plan for the “prevention of extremism and deradicalization,” and legislators called for better staffing of the BVT’s extremism section.The BVT monitors an estimated 94 persons who returned to Austria from conflict zones, and the Interior Ministry estimated at the end of 2018 more than 100 Austrian FTFs were still in Syria and Iraq.  Overall, the BVT noted that terrorist mobilization substantially declined after 2015.Austria is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and a member of the Coalition’s Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Stabilization working groups.  Law enforcement agencies focused on intelligence gathering and investigations, as well as on sharing information with international partners.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Austria in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Austria has an extensive legal structure to counter terrorism.  Relevant statutes criminalize training in terrorist camps abroad and allow wiretapping of individual suspects or small groups with the permission of an independent judge or ombudsman.  Specific regulations prohibit the use and distribution of symbols attributable to ISIS or al-Qa’ida.  An amendment passed in December 2018 to the Symbol Act took effect in February 2019, criminalizing the display of symbols related to the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, the Grey Wolves, the PKK, and the Croatian Ustasha.As of 2019, all mobile airtime cards must be registered.  Additional legislation regulates use of International Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers – telephone eavesdropping devices that allow localization of mobile phones without contacting mobile operators.  The Constitutional Court in 2019 declared a law on surveillance unconstitutional on privacy grounds before it took effect.  The law would have allowed authorities to tap messenger services such as WhatsApp and Skype in cases of suspected terrorism with a court order.Austrian law enforcement and BVT officials routinely cooperated with U.S. law enforcement in a range of areas, including joint investigative projects and enforcement operations.Austria has taken a whole-of-government approach to implement UNSCRs related to CT and the GCTF’s Good Practices on Addressing the Challenge of Returning Families of FTFs.  Austrian law criminalizes “travel for terrorism purposes” with sentences of six months to five years in prison, extends domestic jurisdiction to individuals in Austria who committed a crime abroad, and ensures legal counsel for terror victims.  This law implements the EU Directive on Combating Terrorism and the UN’s International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.In 2019, Austria extended temporary border checks with its Schengen neighbor countries, introduced in 2016, and continued to deploy more than 800 soldiers at its eastern borders.  Regulations allow border authorities to prevent minors from leaving Austria upon suspicion they will participate in fighting activities abroad.  Border security forces made effective use of security measures, including biographic and biometric screening capabilities at ports of entry and information sharing internally and with other EU countries.  In 2019, the Austrian Army and the U.S. National Guard began exchanging best practices in border protection as part of a partnership that also includes training for Austrian and U.S. non-commissioned officers in both countries.Austria has rigorous processes in place to register and screen individuals applying for asylum, lawful residence, and citizenship.  Authorities are allowed to confiscate up to 840 euros from asylum seekers to cover costs related to the asylum proceedings and to analyze their phones and storage devices to obtain data on the routes traveled.  Authorities check applicants’ fingerprints against the EU’s asylum fingerprint database (Eurodac) and, in select cases, against criminal databases.  Authorities screen individuals against national and international law enforcement databases before citizenship is approved.Vienna CT squads arrested and charged two suspects in December for planning terrorist attacks in Austria, Germany, and Luxembourg, together with an imprisoned ISIS sympathizer.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Austria is a member of the FATF.  Its FIU, the Austrian Financial Intelligence Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019. Countering Violent Extremism:  Austria continued its CVE efforts largely in response to the FTF phenomenon.  The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) worked with the Islamic Faith Community to conduct an information campaign in mosques, Islamic organizations, community centers, and prisons.  To counter “extremism” and improve integration among newly arrived refugees, the MFA’s Integration Office conducted an educational program to teach German language and Austrian values such as equality and democratic principles.  In addition, the Austrian government expanded its draft action plan to implement terrorist prevention policies laid out in a national strategy.  This includes a comprehensive “exit program” for radicalized youth.  The Austrian government maintained a counseling center and a de-radicalization hotline aimed at friends and family members of potential terrorists.  The Ministry of Justice presented measures aimed at “extremist prevention, deradicalization, and disengagement” among Austria’s prison population.The U.S. Embassy to Austria and the Department of State’s Counterterrorism Bureau co-hosted a CVE workshop to exchange best practices across the region.  CT Bureau sent a former white supremacist to Austria to provide authentic testimonials about the destructive nature of terrorism and hate.  International and Regional Cooperation:  Austria is a member of international and regional security platforms, including the UN, the CoE, the EU, the OSCE, the Salzburg Forum, and the Central European Initiative.  Austria remained active in the Western Balkans Counter Terrorism Initiative, a platform it initiated in 2015.  Austria participates in Eurojust’s EU-wide terrorism register, which lists all ongoing terrorism investigations of individual EU member states.In 2019 the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Austria (and Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary) for their 2018 agreement with Western Balkans countries to streamline certain information sharing, including in terrorism cases. In 2019, the Azerbaijani government actively worked to deter, detect, and defeat terrorist efforts to move people, money, and materials across its land and maritime borders and within the South Caucasus.  Azerbaijani law enforcement and security services conducted operations to disrupt and prevent terror attacks, arrested and prosecuted suspected terrorists, and prosecuted returning Azerbaijanis suspected of joining or financing terrorist groups fighting outside Azerbaijan.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Azerbaijan in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, Azerbaijan made no significant changes to the legislation on combating terrorism.Azerbaijani law enforcement and security services have demonstrated adequate capacity to detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism in Azerbaijan’s territory.  Responsibility for Counterterrorism is vested in several government agencies.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) is Azerbaijan’s primary law enforcement agency, and its Organized Crime Unit is tasked with leading the Ministry’s CT efforts.  The MIA cooperates closely with the State Security Service (SSS), Azerbaijan’s domestic intelligence and CT service.  The SSS is responsible for identifying and preventing criminal activities by terrorist groups and countering international terrorism and transnational crimes.  Law enforcement and security agencies continued to exhibit wide discretion in determining what activities qualify as “terrorism” or “extremism,” leaving political opponents and religious activists vulnerable to prosecution, detention, and physical mistreatment.  Such individuals have been especially vulnerable to physical abuse by the MIA’s organized crime unit.  For further information, see the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and International Religious Freedom Report.The Special State Protection Service is a security agency under the Presidential Administration tasked with protecting the Azerbaijani president, visiting foreign heads of state and government, and critical infrastructure and strategic state resources, such as oil and gas pipelines.  The State Border Service (SBS) and the State Customs Committee jointly manage border security, and interdict terrorist efforts to move people, money, and materials – including weapons of mass destruction – across Azerbaijan’s land and maritime borders.  The SBS is also responsible for defending offshore oil platforms against terrorism.  The Prosecutor General’s Office is responsible for prosecuting suspects accused of terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, conspiracy to aid terrorism, and other terrorism-related crimes.Azerbaijan used terrorist and criminal watchlists and biographic/biometric screening at ports of entry.  Azerbaijan’s law enforcement and security services share information among themselves, and with regional and international partners regarding terrorism matters.    Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Azerbaijan is a member of MONEYVAL.  Its FIU, the Financial Monitoring Service, is a member of the Egmont Group.  In 2019, Azerbaijan continued implementing its “National Action Plan for 2017-2019 on combating criminally acquired money, legalization of other properties, and financing of terrorism.”Countering Violent Extremism:  The State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations announced in April it is jointly developing with the Ministry of Education and the Caucasus Muslim Board a religion course that will be included in the curriculum of public middle schools and public universities in Azerbaijan as early as September 2020.  According to the Committee, the course would promote the state’s “secular policy and help counter the spread of radical and fundamentalist movements.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Azerbaijan maintained membership in the CoE, the OSCE, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and other international bodies.  Azerbaijan supports NATO CT initiatives as one of the Alliance’s Partnership for Peace countries.  Azerbaijan participated in NATO’s Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, where it deployed 120 peacekeeping troops, and contributed to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund.Belgium continues to make incremental improvements to CT-related policy, information-sharing practices, and resource allotments, which have enhanced authorities’ abilities to investigate and prevent terrorist attacks.  Belgium actively shares terrorist and criminal information with the United States under the Visa Waiver Program.  However, Belgium’s highly decentralized government presents challenges to effective internal information sharing and cooperation, and the caretaker status of Belgium’s government throughout 2019 hampered its ability to make meaningful policy advancements.  Belgian law enforcement authorities remain under-resourced.  The Belgian criminal code’s short sentencing guidelines limit the criminal justice system’s ability to deter and prevent terrorist activity.  The country’s greatest terrorism threat is homegrown terrorism, including both Islamist extremism and, to a lesser extent, REMT, which Belgium calls “violent right-wing extremism.”  Belgium is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and plans to resume contributing troops and airstrike capabilities to the Defeat ISIS military campaign in 2020.Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist attacks in Belgium during 2019.  However, security forces interrupted a small number of attacks in the planning stages and also intervened with persons providing material support to terrorists.  The following list provides a sampling of successful interventions:On January 24, police arrested three individuals (in Bruges, Leuven, and Molenbeek) on suspicion of participation in terrorist activities.  After releasing the individual from Leuven, prosecutors charged the remaining two in October with funding a terrorist group.On March 15, the Belgian Federal Police arrested an individual who had anonymously placed an online threat against the Antwerp Central train station in retaliation for the March 2019 New Zealand mosque attacks.On June 22, police arrested Matthew Govaert in Brussels for plotting an attack against the U.S. Embassy in Brussels.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Belgium’s primary CT-related actors include the Belgian Federal Police, the civilian and military security and intelligence services, and the Office of the Federal Prosecutor.  The Ministry of Interior maintains a Crisis Center.  The interagency Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis, consisting of representatives from the ministries of Interior, Justice Finance, Treasury, and Transport, as well as the security sector, assesses and sets country-wide threat level ratings and maintains Belgium’s database of foreign fighters, hate preachers, and homegrown terrorists.  The National Security Council also plays a significant role in intelligence and security decisions.  Belgium’s highly devolved government structure presents challenges to effective internal communication and cooperation between Belgium’s numerous law enforcement and criminal justice entities.  Government-wide resource constraints impair Belgium’s ability to proactively detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism.  As of December 2019, Belgium had failed to fully implement July 2018 amendments to its criminal code allowing the use of civil information.  Belgium’s short prison sentences continued to reduce the efficacy of an amendment in 2018 allowing plea bargaining.  Belgium implemented the EU PNR directive for airport travelers through the establishment of the Belgian Passenger Information Unit in early 2018 and has continued, throughout 2019, to integrate additional airline companies and to test practical implications for adding PNR analytic capabilities on additional transport modes, such as international rail and bus systems.  In 2019, Belgium held the chair of Europol’s Informal Working Group on PNR, hosting meetings that resulted in proposals to carry PNR forward Europe-wide.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Belgium is a member of the FATF.  Its FIU, the Belgian Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Belgium is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s Counter-ISIS Finance Group (CIFG).  On September 12, 2019, a Belgian court sentenced Amadou Mugabo to 100 hours of community service and fines for financial support of terrorism after it was uncovered that he was sending funds to a known FTF in Syria or Iraq.Countering Violent Extremism:  Belgium’s federal, regional, and local governments remained engaged in CVE efforts through 2019, despite ongoing institutional and resource constraints.  Local task forces constituted in 2014 and expanded in 2018 continue to meet to coordinate CVE responses among local security, municipal, and social services personnel, a key recommendation of the Parliamentary Investigative Commission’s final report on the March 22, 2016, terrorist attacks in Brussels.  In March, after negotiations between the two countries, Saudi Arabia relinquished control of the Brussels Grand Mosque in alignment with the Parliamentary Investigative Commission’s finding that Saudi Arabia’s Muslim World League was partially responsible for the Islamist extremism that motivated the perpetrators of the 2016 attacks in Belgium.  In December, Belgium’s prison population included at least 227 persons jailed for links to ISIS or al-Qa’ida.  Prisoners charged or convicted with terrorism-related offenses were generally transferred to prisons with segregated sections for radicalized inmates, though many become eligible for parole upon completing one third to two thirds of a typical five-year sentence.  Prisoner rehabilitation resources remained minimal, and regional governments continued to struggle to fill vacancies for positions with CVE responsibilities.  The Belgian cities of Antwerp and Vilvoorde are members of the SCN, and city officials from Antwerp traveled to San Diego and Los Angeles as part of the program in October.  In November, Belgian officials from Liege and Verviers traveled to the United States to exchange best practices on preventing and countering terrorism with officials from Nashville and Chattanooga, Tennessee, under the City-Pair Program.International and Regional Cooperation:  Belgium participates in CT efforts with the EU, NATO, the OSCE, and CoE, and Belgium is a member of the advisory board of the UN Counterterrorism Center.  Belgium’s Michèle Coninsx remained Executive Director of the UN Counterterrorism Executive Directorate throughout 2019.  Belgium used its nonpermanent seat in the UN Security Council (UNSC) during 2019 to promote prison deradicalization and awareness of the humanitarian consequences of counterterror actions.  Belgium is also an active contributor to the subcommittees of the UNSC that deal with counterterror.  Belgium is a troop-contributing member of the European Union Training Mission in Mali.  Belgium is also a troop-contributing member of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali.  Belgium participated in all EU efforts to interdict FTF travel across land and maritime borders, encouraged efforts to strengthen Schengen zone external borders, and maintained a leading role in the European Strategic Communication Network.Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) remained a cooperative counterterrorism partner and continued to increase its CT capacity in 2019.  There were no known registered BiH citizens who attempted to travel to foreign battlefields in 2019, although dozens remain in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine, and BiH continues to face the threat of returning fighters.  BiH continues to be a willing partner in repatriation of FTFs, and the BiH Presidency agreed in November 2019 to repatriate some family members of FTFs from Syria.  Seventeen women and children were repatriated, along with seven fighters, in December 2019.  BiH law enforcement agencies have been very cooperative on this effort.  Lenient sentencing in terrorism cases remained a challenge, but recent judgments indicate some judges recognize a need to apply more rigid sanctions.  Operational coordination continues internally in BiH and with U.S. partners.  However, interpersonal and interagency infighting and stove piping undermine fully effective cooperation, especially due to a lack of strategic guidance from the Ministry of Security.  While little progress was made on rehabilitation and de-radicalization, diverse civil society groups, the Interreligious Council, and individual religious leaders made notable efforts to prevent and counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in BiH in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  BiH made no significant changes to its CT legislation in 2019.  A group of parliamentarians proposed draft amendments to further align BiH law with EU directives on the suppression of terrorism and to introduce three new crimes to the BiH criminal code in 2018, but general elections in October 2018 and slow government formation delayed progress.  The amendments would criminalize traveling and residing abroad for terrorism, misusing information technology or cyber technology for terrorist purposes, and forging documents for the purposes of terrorism.  The draft amendments also strengthen an existing criminal code provision on training for terrorist activities.  Although the amendments again need to be submitted to Parliament, there is some political will to adopt them.The State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) continues to be the lead law enforcement unit performing CT functions.  However, with approximately 25 officers working on CT cases, its effectiveness is limited, and there were no political efforts in 2019 to increase the size of SIPA’s counterterrorism unit, despite a draft law pending in Parliament since 2017.  As an alternative to changes to the law, SIPA recently considered a change to its internal by-laws to increase the number of officers.  SIPA continues to receive training funded by the U.S. Department of State’s ATA program to ensure that key units can effectively investigate terrorism-related crimes.A BiH Prosecutor’s Office-led task force met more frequently in 2019, but law enforcement cooperation at a more strategic level continued to suffer from some interpersonal and institutional infighting, as well as BiH’s complex governmental structure.  At the operational level, however, law enforcement and prosecutors met and worked jointly on certain cases.  Law enforcement agencies also worked effectively together on responding to returning fighters, and their family members from Syria, although the Ministry of Security did not have a comprehensive plan for reintegrating and rehabilitating family members.There is a lack of political will to implement U.S.-funded initiatives, despite a desire from BiH law enforcement to have these tools.  The Presidency of BiH did not move to approve a proposal to support use of API/PNR as part of its integrated border management and in line with UNSCR 2396.  There was some progress on border security initiatives, as the Border Police continued to implement upgrades to technology at key points of entry and the Foreigners’ Affairs Service worked proactively with international partners to exchange information on the continually higher number of migrants entering BiH.BiH continued its efforts to disrupt terrorist activity in 2019 through arrests and indictments.  In November, the Court of BiH increased the sentences for Maksim Božić and Edin Hastor to six years (from four years) and three years (from two years, six months) of imprisonment for planning terrorist acts, respectively; this was a final verdict and is considered high for BiH.  BiH also began to prosecute its citizens for joining foreign paramilitary forces under the same provision it uses to prosecute people who join ISIS.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  BiH is a member of MONEYVAL.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Department, is a member of the Egmont Group.  In 2019, in line with UNSCR 1373, the BiH Council of Ministers designated Mirsad Kandić for asset freezing.Countering Violent Extremism:  “Extremist ideology and regional nationalist” groups remain potential sources of terrorism in BiH.  In 2019, the main religious communities in BiH (Catholic, Islamic, Jewish, and Orthodox) worked together through the Interreligious Council to promote tolerance and confront acts of bigotry or violence directed at any of these communities.  The Interreligious Council also increased its coordination and activities with its 15 regional chapters, with an emphasis on increasing engagement with women and youth – through social media campaigns and other strategies.  Individual religious leaders and civil society groups (formal and informal) across the country also made increasing efforts to identify “extremist influences” and sources of resiliency in their communities, supported by a range of international donors and organizations.  International and local actors working on countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment made significant efforts in broadening their analysis beyond radical Islam to include extreme ethno-nationalism and foreign influence, as well as domestic drivers of “extreme ideologies.”The BiH Ministry of Security partnered with the international community on numerous CVE programs in BiH.  Working with international organizations, BiH supported efforts to strengthen resiliencies within identified at-risk communities, and it supported efforts by religious and other local actors to counter expressions of intolerance at the local and municipal levels.  The BiH cities of Bihać, Bijeljina, Doboj, Jablanica, Prijedor, Srebrenik, and Tuzla Canton – and the municipality of Centar (Sarajevo) – are members of the SCN.  There are insufficient mechanisms to measure progress and implementation of BiH’s CT/CVE Strategy.In 2019, the OSCE presented in Sarajevo its publication on “referral mechanisms for preventing and countering violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism.”  The publication enabled a multidisciplinary, human-rights-compliant, and regionally tailored approach to the identification of those at risk of engaging in violent acts.International and Regional Cooperation:  The BiH Prosecutor’s Office continues to work frequently with the United States, regional neighbors, Serbia and Montenegro, and EU countries such as Austria, Germany, and the UK on CT investigations.  BiH is a member of or participating state in the UN, the OSCE, the Regional Cooperation Council for Southeast Europe, and the Council of Europe (CoE).Bulgaria remains a strong counterterrorism partner of the United States.  While the threat of terrorism in Bulgaria remains relatively low, the government has continued its CT capacity building, including through close and ongoing cooperation with U.S. government agencies, though some capability gaps remain.  Given Bulgaria’s strategic location, many of these efforts have focused on disrupting the transit of FTFs through enhanced border security, traveler screening, and information sharing.  Bulgaria is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Bulgaria.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Bulgaria prosecutes terrorism under several general provisions of the penal code, which has been amended multiple times since it was first enacted in 1968.  In 2015, the National Assembly adopted amendments to the penal code that provide for the prosecution of individuals, including FTFs, who support, plan, and facilitate the commission of terrorist acts in Bulgaria and abroad.  Since 2017, the specialized court for organized crime and its prosecutors’ office have had jurisdiction to prosecute all terrorism cases in the country.The Ministry of the Interior has operational units responsible for deterring, detecting, and responding to terrorist incidents, including the Specialized Unit for Combating Terrorism (SOBT), Security Police, and Special Police Forces, which successfully completed a multi-year training mission with a U.S. Special Operations Liaison Element.  The State Agency for National Security (DANS) has intelligence-gathering units responsible for CT.  Since 2014, DANS also houses the National Counterterrorism Center.  In June, the interior minister and the prosecutor general announced plans to design new CT centers, though they have not yet made public additional details.In 2017, Bulgaria implemented new legislation directing that public buildings, including schools, transportation hubs, and hospitality and tourism sites and facilities – as well as houses of worship and other public facilities – develop CT risk assessments and prevention and response measures in the event of a terrorist attack.  In advance of the summer tourism season on the Black Sea coast, the Ministry of the Interior regularly updates its emergency plans in coordination with its foreign counterparts.Bulgaria continues to implement strong migration controls and maintains an engineered obstacle (fencing with razor wire) and sophisticated monitoring systems along most of the EU’s “external” border with Turkey.  Bulgaria makes widespread use of all available terrorist screening watchlists and shares API data from the biographic passport page of travelers arriving on passenger flights with other EU countries when it encounters watchlisted individuals.  Based on bilateral police cooperation agreements, Bulgaria also shares this type of information with non-EU countries for law enforcement purposes on an as-needed basis.  U.S. government agencies continued to work closely with Bulgarian counterparts through a variety of CT programs aimed at enhancing Bulgaria’s capacity and capabilities.  The Department of State partnered with Bulgaria to implement key screening programs in border security and aviation security.In June, local police arrested and charged a self-radicalized 16-year-old Bulgarian student with planning a terrorist attack in the city of Plovdiv.  The suspect had reportedly assembled several improvised explosive devices.  As of December, the specialized court for organized crime is still hearing the case against two suspected accomplices in Hizballah’s 2012 Burgas airport bombing, following procedural issues that caused multiple delays in the trial.Bulgaria relies heavily on specialized law enforcement units like SOBT for a wide range of missions, including CT and border security operations, but it has not adequately invested in training and equipping these units.  Moreover, resources are concentrated in Sofia and the units there lack the airlift capabilities needed to respond in a timely manner to incidents elsewhere in the country.  Similarly, the specialized court for organized crime has not been adequately staffed and resourced to handle the increased workload resulting from its new jurisdiction over terrorism cases.  Bulgarian authorities also do not have extensive and recent experience investigating and prosecuting CT cases and do not regularly employ interagency task forces that would be necessary to effectively handle complex investigations.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Bulgaria is a member of MONEYVAL.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Directorate – State Agency for National Security, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Bulgaria is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.In September, Bulgarian prosecutors indicted a group of five Syrians and one Bulgarian on charges of terrorist financing.  The General Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime arrested the group in January for allegedly transferring more than $10 million through the hawala system and purchasing and transporting to the Turkish-Syrian border more than 100 vehicles in support of terrorist organizations in Syria such as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government is implementing its 2015-2020 Strategy for Countering Radicalization and Terrorism.  In October, the government approved a report for activities undertaken in 2018 and an action plan for 2019.In December, the Pazardzhik District Court sentenced to prison Islamic preacher Ahmed Mussa and 13 of his followers within the Roma Muslim community for propagating religious hatred and incitement to war in support of ISIS.  The group had allegedly helped smuggle across the border several FTFs en route to Syria, though it is not clear whether they were fully aware of the FTFs’ terrorist affiliation, and some human rights groups have viewed the proceedings as an infringement on religious freedom.  Mussa has been in prison since April, serving a four-year sentence for “spreading an antidemocratic ideology and incitement of war, religious hatred, and discrimination.”  Bulgarian authorities continue to have concerns that the city of Pazardzhik could once again serve as a waypoint for FTFs if ongoing conflicts in the Middle East trigger another massive influx of migrants.In December, the Bulgarian government co-hosted with the Department of State and the International Republican Institute a regional forum focused on building resilience to terrorist radicalization and recruitment in the Western Balkans.  Participants from throughout the region explored ways to strengthen regional cooperation and increase the exchange of information in the fight against terrorism.International and Regional Cooperation:  Bulgaria is a member of and active contributor to CT initiatives at the UN, the EU, NATO, the OSCE, and the Organization for Black Sea Economic Cooperation.The Republic of Cyprus collaborated closely with the United States, the EU, and other countries – bilaterally and multilaterally – in international counterterrorism efforts in 2019.  In particular, Cyprus continued to make significant progress on strengthening its banking sector’s CFT efforts.  The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.Since 1974, the island of Cyprus has been divided de facto into the Republic of Cyprus government-controlled area in the southern two thirds of the island, and the northern third which is administered by the Turkish Cypriots.  A UN peacekeeping force patrols a buffer zone, also called “the Green Line,” which separates the two sides.  The buffer zone is largely open to civilian traffic and remains a significant route for the illicit transit of people, narcotics, and other contraband.The division of the island has impeded CT cooperation between the two communities and between the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey, which do not maintain diplomatic relations.  This report covers only the Republic of Cyprus.  It does not address terrorism or CT efforts in the areas under the administration of Turkish Cypriots.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in the Republic of Cyprus in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In November 2019, the United States and the Republic of Cyprus marked the first anniversary of the joint Statement of Intent on Security Cooperation, noting progress on several fronts.The Republic of Cyprus is working with the United States to create the Cyprus Center for Land, Open-seas, and Port Security (CYCLOPS), a $5 million regional training center focused on border security, including preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and related materiel.The Republic of Cyprus began implementing the EU PNR Directive in 2019 after passing requisite legislation in December 2018.In November 2019, the Republic of Cyprus proposed amendments to the way it implements the so called “Green Line Regulation,” which governs crossing the green line between the Republic of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriot-administered areas.  According to the Republic of Cyprus, the amendments are aimed at strengthening security and monitoring of green line crossings.  It is likely that the amendments must be approved by the EU; the ROC has not yet submitted the amendments to Brussels.Republic of Cyprus law enforcement officials participated in several U.S.-sponsored training programs on border security, CT, and CFT.The Republic of Cyprus passed but still has not fully implemented a law regulating undercover activities by police officers.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The Republic of Cyprus is a member of MONEYVAL.  Its FIU, the Unit for Combating Money Laundering (MOKAS), is a member of the Egmont Group.The Republic of Cyprus underwent a mutual evaluation by MONEYVAL in 2019.  Before the MONEYVAL evaluation team visit, the Republic of Cyprus completed a National Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment based on World Bank tools.  The Republic of Cyprus endorsed a national AML/CFT Action Plan to address issues raised in the risk assessment.  Those efforts will be reexamined to ensure complementarity with the outcomes of the MONEYVAL report.  Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no significant changes in Cyprus’s CVE efforts in 2019. The Kingdom of Denmark (which includes Greenland and the Faroe Islands) devoted significant assets to CT programs, domestically and abroad.  Denmark cooperates closely with the United States, the UN, and the EU on CT initiatives, including within the GCTF and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.According to the Ministry of Justice, at least 158 people from Denmark have traveled to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS since 2012.  The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) remained concerned that Danish fighters returning to Denmark with terrorist training would seek to radicalize others.  According to the PET-administered Center for Terror Analysis (CTA), the primary terrorist threat to Denmark is small, simple attacks perpetrated by radicalized members of the Islamic community.  Radicalization in prison facilities remains a particular concern.  CTA also assesses a limited but increasing threat from other terrorist actors who target Denmark’s asylum centers, religious minorities, and migrants.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Denmark’s Parliament passed an emergency bill on October 24 that provides the immigration and integration minister the authority to strip dual-national FTFs of their Danish citizenship.  Lawmakers fast-tracked the bill because of concerns that detained ISIS fighters could escape SDF detention as Turkish forces entered northeast Syria.  The legislation, which allows citizenship revocation without a trial, states that anyone acting in a manner seriously prejudicial to Denmark’s vital interests may have their Danish citizenship revoked, unless the person would become stateless.On January 1, Denmark adopted a PNR law that allows the government to gather airplane passengers’ personal data.  Danish authorities collect PNR data from air carriers and make this information available to Danish security and intelligence services.Denmark continued to use its 2006 terrorism legislation that allows information sharing between its agencies responsible for CT and FTFs – the PET and the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS).  Efforts to counter terrorism are also shared among the Danish National Police, the Public Prosecution Service, and the Danish Prison and Probation Service.  Danish security and law enforcement agencies share information through the CTA, which – as the Danish government’s intelligence fusion center – constitutes the focal point for reporting from the Danish National Police, PET, DDIS, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Danish Emergency Management Agency.  The Danish police and the Danish defense forces share responsibility for preventing terrorist attacks in Copenhagen and on the borders.Counterterrorism-related prosecutions and actions by law enforcement included:On May 20, a Syrian asylum seeker received a 12-year prison sentence for planning to detonate explosive devices in Copenhagen in 2016.  Moyed Al Zoebi was found guilty in April and was determined to have acted on behalf of ISIS.On November 28, three men were convicted of promoting ISIS by supplying drone equipment to ISIS fighters from 2013 to 2017.  Two of the defendants were acquitted of more serious terrorism charges.  The sentences ranged from two and a half to four years’ confinement.On December 11, Danish police arrested 21 individuals suspected of terrorist activities.  Police raided and searched 20 locations spanning seven police districts in connection with the terrorism investigation.  Eight suspects were charged in Copenhagen with serious terrorism offenses that carry potential life sentences if convicted.  Police spokespersons said that the accused individuals attempted to obtain firearms and possessed materials used to build explosive devices.  A PET official said they believed that a “militant, Islamist motive” motivated the suspects.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Denmark is a member of the FATF.  Its FIU, The Money Laundering Secretariat (FIU Denmark), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Denmark is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  In September, Denmark pledged $2 million in support of Ethiopia’s efforts to counter terrorist financing as part of a larger commitment to support global CT efforts.Countering Violent Extremism:  In September, Denmark committed nearly $1.5 million for a CVE center under the regional organization for the countries of the Horn of Africa:  the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).  Denmark’s foreign minister also pledged $2 million to the GCERF, a global fund dedicated to countering radicalization and recruitment.  In April, the U.S. embassy sponsored American Imam Talib Sharif to speak in Copenhagen to various religious and interfaith groups about anti-radicalization and community activism.  Denmark’s National Center for the Prevention of Extremism announced in October that it would fund a postdoctoral program focused on “extreme Islamism” in the country.  The National Center also partnered with University College Syd to develop learning materials aimed at giving children tools to maintain a critical approach to information they encounter online and on social media.International and Regional Cooperation:  The Danish government is committed to working within the UN framework, through the EU, and with other international and regional organizations.  Denmark actively participates in the GCTF, the CoE, NATO, the OSCE, INTERPOL, the Bern Club, and the European Counterterrorism Center.  In October, Denmark announced new military deployments to the Sahel region supporting both the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali, MINUSMA, and the French-led CT mission in the Sahel, Operation Barkhane.France remained a key partner of the United States in international CT efforts in 2019.  It is a longstanding and important member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  France continued to conduct important CT operations in Iraq, Libya, Mali, Syria and the Sahel region, as well as in the Lake Chad Basin.The terrorist threat in France remained high but was lower than its 2015 peak.  French law enforcement remained concerned with the threat of domestic terrorism inspired by or affiliated with ISIS.  French law enforcement and intelligence agencies thwarted at least four attacks in 2019 and arrested at least 12 individuals on Islamist terrorism-related charges.  French authorities also arrested two individuals linked to REMT.  The new national CT prosecutor’s office became operational in July and is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of all terrorism-related cases.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Four suspected terrorist attacks took place in 2019, with limited casualties.  Below are the details on each of the attacks.On March 5, a prison inmate and his girlfriend in Condé-sur-Sarthe carried out a knife attack against two prison guards while in the family visiting unit.  The girlfriend smuggled a ceramic knife inside the prison.  She girlfriend died during the police response, while the assailant and two prison guards were injured.  The attacker had pledged allegiance to ISIS.On May 24, a package filled with screws and nails exploded in Lyon’s city center, injuring 13 people.  With the help of Lyon’s system of surveillance cameras, the suspect was identified and arrested three days later.  The attacker was reportedly a 24-year-old male Algerian national who had pledged allegiance to ISIS.On October 3, a 45-year-old male employee carried out an insider knife attack inside Paris Police Headquarters, killing four colleagues and injuring one before he was shot dead.  While the assailant had ties to radicalized Salafists and ISIS propaganda was found in his possession, he also harbored grievances related to his treatment as a person with deafness and muteness.On October 28, an 84-year-old male with ties to the National Gathering party attempted to set fire to a mosque in the southern city of Bayonne.  The attacker shot two worshippers who caught him in the act.  The attacker claimed he was avenging the fire of the Notre Dame Cathedral, which he blamed on Muslims.  The government charged the attacker with attempted homicide but did not categorize the attack as terrorism.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  On July 15, the government released its new French National Intelligence Strategy (2019-2024), and countering terrorism is the government’s top priority.  The strategy breaks down the ongoing domestic terrorism threat into three categories:  “projected” threats (from overseas to France), threats “inspired” by terrorist organizations, and groups that may be susceptible to “Islamist radicalization.”The French armed forces continued Operation Sentinelle, a domestic deployment of up to 7,000 soldiers to enhance security at sensitive sites and large events throughout the country.  France maintained extraordinary border controls, in place since November 2015, with its Schengen neighbors.France has a fully operational inter-ministerial Passenger Information Unit (PIU) that uses API/PNR data to screen arriving and departing passenger data against other police and administrative databases.  In accordance with French privacy laws, the data is accessible only by PIU staff.  To query API/PNR data, police/intelligence services must submit requests, which are approved on a case-by-case basis.  French agencies each have their own fingerprint and/or biometric systems, which are not always compatible with one another and do not cross-pollinate, potentially impeding efforts to identify FTFs returning to France or Europe.On March 23, the new national counterterrorism prosecutor’s office (PNAT) was created as part of judicial reforms.  The PNAT became operational in July and is responsible for the judicial investigation and prosecution of all terrorism-related cases.  With a team of 27 prosecutors, the PNAT worked with the United States to incorporate U.S.-collected battlefield intelligence to prosecute terrorists.French law enforcement is highly effective in handling terrorism cases.  According to French government sources, France thwarted at least four attacks in 2019, including one 9/11-inspired terror attack.  Most terrorism-related arrests were made by domestic intelligence and involved individuals and groups suspected of having links to ISIS, but authorities also targeted Shiite and REMT groups. To improve internal information sharing to combat terrorism, on February 18 the government created an interagency coordination office including 13 intelligence and law enforcement agencies.Some high-profile terrorist cases in the judicial system include:On October 14, the Special Criminal Court sentenced the two main defendants of a female jihadist cell to 25 and 30 years in prison over a failed attempt to detonate a car bomb outside Notre Dame Cathedral in September 2016.On October 21, the PNAT completed its investigation of the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.  The PNAT also received U.S.-provided assistance, including intelligence collected from the battlefield.  The trial is expected to begin in 2021.Also on October 21, the PNAT completed its investigation of the August 2015 Thalys train attack, in which three U.S. citizens stopped the attacker.  A date for the trial has not been announced.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  France is a member of the FATF.  Its FIU, the Intelligence Processing and Action against Illicit Financial Networks Unit (Tracfin), is a member of the Egmont Group.  France is also a member of the Defeat ISIS CIFG.In November, France published new guidelines on the risk approach, due diligence requirements for clients and their beneficiaries, the notion of politically exposed persons, and the obligation to report to Tracfin.  France included countering the financing of terrorism as one of the three priorities to counter terrorism during its G-7 presidency.France continued to investigate and prosecute financing of terrorism cases in 2019.  French banks reported about 2,500 suspicious transactions to Tracfin in 2019, with 70 percent investigated for links to terrorism financing.  On November 7, the Paris appeals court determined that French-Swiss firm Lafarge had violated international embargoes as it sought to maintain operations at its cement plant in Jalabiya, Syria.  The company was indicted in 2018 for making payments to ISIS to protect the plant.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, the government continued to implement its 2018 National Plan to Prevent Radicalization.  Presenting its one-year assessment of the plan’s implementation at an April 11 press conference, the government identified four areas where additional focus is required to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment:  prison, delinquency prevention programs, poverty prevention programs, and government programs to promote social cohesion.In May, France hosted and co-chaired with New Zealand the Christchurch Call to Action Summit in Paris.  Bringing together several countries and technology companies, the Christchurch Call aims to eliminate terrorist content online.  On September 19 on the margins of the UN General Assembly, France also released a “Charter for a Free, Open, and Safe Internet” for governments and companies to endorse.  On September 23, France then co-sponsored with New Zealand and Jordan at the United Nations the high-level “Leaders Dialogue:  Strategic Responses to Terrorist and Violent Extremist Narratives.”Following the October 3 insider attack at the Paris Police headquarters, the Office of Intelligence Services Inspection conducted an assessment of “radicalization among government officials.”  As of October 21, approximately 67 police officers were flagged for possible radicalization.  Of those, approximately 20 were dismissed, three were suspended, and two had to turn in their weapons.  Bordeaux, Montreuil, Paris, and Sarcelles are members of the SCN.  Alumni of Department of State-sponsored City Pair exchanges participated in a CVE symposium in Paris in April with counterparts from Belgium, Germany, the UK, and the United States.International and Regional Cooperation:  France is a founding member of the GCTF and actively participates in the OSCE.  France plays a vital role on the UN Security Council ISIL and al-Qa’ida Sanctions Committee.  The French government undertook joint CT operations with several EU partners and played an active role in CT capacity building in other countries, particularly in West Africa.In 2019, Georgia, a longstanding member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, continued its robust engagement with the United States across a range of CT-related issues.  Georgia participated in numerous bilateral CT exercises and trainings with the United States and remained a strong U.S. security partner.  The State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) is Georgia’s lead agency for terrorism-related incidents and investigations.  In addition to implementing several amendments to the criminal code aimed at strengthening CT legislation, Georgia adopted its three-year National Strategy for the Fight Against Terrorism and action plan following the establishment of its SSSG-led Permanent Interagency Commission in 2018.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents in Georgia in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Georgia is generally capable of detecting, deterring, and responding to terrorism incidents.  The SSSG is the lead agency handling terrorism-related incidents and investigations, and is generally well equipped and well trained.  The SSSG’s Counterterrorism Unit continues to receive regular training and equipment.  In January, recognizing the need for a whole-of-government response to the challenges of terrorism, the Georgian government approved the National Strategy of Georgia on the Fight Against Terrorism 2019-2021 with an accompanying action plan.  The SSSG-chaired Permanent Interagency Commission is responsible for oversight of the strategy and action plan and providing annual status reports on implementation.  In 2019, Georgia also carried out exercises to enhance interoperability and cooperation between agencies with CT-related mandates.Georgia continued in 2019 to improve its border, maritime, and aviation security.  The EU is supporting Georgia with implementation of its API/PNR data systems in line with UNSCR 2396. In November, Georgian authorities cooperated closely with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and other international partners in the SBU’s detention of ISIS commander and Georgian citizen Tsezar Tokhosashvili, aka Al Bara Shishani, in Ukraine.  Tokhosashvili, who was deputy to former ISIS commander and Georgian citizen Tarkhan Batirashvili, aka Abu Omar al Shishani, entered Ukraine on falsified documents in 2018 and had been coordinating ISIS activities from Ukraine over the past year.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Georgia is a member of MONEYVAL.  Georgia’s FIU, the Financial Monitoring Service of Georgia (FMS), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Georgia is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.On October 30, Georgia adopted the Law on Facilitating the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing, which the FMS drafted.  The new legislation aims to create effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, enhances the ability of law enforcement to retrieve information from the FMS, and includes insurance brokers, law firms, and certified accountants in the list of reporting entities.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, Georgia continued its CVE efforts by focusing on initiatives in education, civic and political participation, media and access to information, gender equality, preserving minority culture and identity, justice and law-enforcement activities, and social and regional integration.In June, Georgia and the OSCE jointly hosted a seminar on the involvement of society in the prevention of terrorism.  The seminar, the first of its kind to be hosted in Tbilisi, emphasized prevention-oriented measures as a key component of Georgia’s National Strategy on the Fight Against Terrorism.  In 2019, Georgia continued to work with international and local partners on multi-year CVE projects including the “Pankisi Eco-Links” project with USAID, which aims to bridge inter-community divides and economic and social isolation in the Pankisi Gorge region by facilitating people-to-people interactions around economic incentives.International and Regional Cooperation:  Georgia is actively engaged on CT issues at the international, regional, and bilateral levels.  Georgia cooperates closely with NATO; the CoE; the OSCE; the Organization of Black Sea Economic Cooperation; and the Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova (GUAM) Organization for Democracy and Economic Development.In November, Georgia and the EU jointly hosted a seminar for media and civil society representatives in Georgia on the role of media in countering terrorism and organized crime.  The seminar aimed to deepen cooperation between media and law enforcement on CT issues, and experts from the United Kingdom presented best practices.In 2019, Georgia participated in the third and fourth plenary meetings of the CoE’s CT committee.  The SSSG also represented Georgia in the 22nd and 23rd sessions of GUAM’s Counterterrorism sub-working group.Germany continued its CT cooperation with the United States and the international community as a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and the GCTF and in multilateral CT operations in Africa and the Middle East.  In 2019, Germany allocated more resources toward combating all forms of terrorism.  Law enforcement targeted a range of suspects, including Islamist terrorists and REMT actors.  German officials describe the latter as an increasing trend and the greatest threat to national security.  A new 10-point plan outlined in October 2019 commits, among other things, to create more than 700 new jobs in federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies focused on combating REMT (which Germany refers to as “right-wing extremism), including a dedicated unit to monitor related online activities.  The 2018 report by Germany’s domestic security agency, which contains the most recent statistics available, reported there were 24,100 REMT actors, 100 more than in 2017, of whom 12,700 were considered “violence-oriented.”  The number of violent crimes committed by these extremists rose by 3.2 percent, from 1,054 in 2017 to 1,088 in 2018.   2019 Terrorist Incidents:In June 2019, a Neo-Nazi extremist shot and killed politician Walter Lübcke (of the Christian Democratic Union).On October 9, a man armed with multiple firearms and home-made bombs attempted to force his way into a synagogue in Halle during Yom Kippur prayers, instead killing two other victims at random.  The perpetrator posted video and text material online expressing extremist anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and misogynistic ideology and admiration for earlier perpetrators of racially or ethnically motivated terrorism.On November 19, police arrested a Syrian national in Berlin on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack and communicating with Islamist extremists on ways to manufacture weapons and explosives.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Germany bolstered its CT tools in 2019 through amendments to the Nationality Act that entered into force on August 8.  Germans with dual citizenship who participate in combat activities for a foreign terrorist group abroad can now lose their German citizenship.  The amendment applies only to adults who have a second nationality.  It will not be applied retroactively, and thus will not apply to German citizen fighters currently held in SDF custody in Syria.In a ruling related to a legal petition by German citizen family members of a FTF to be repatriated from the conflict zone, the Berlin/Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court ruled November 6 that the importance of preserving the constitutionally protected family unit must be weighed against the potential security threat posed by the returnee.  The court stated it must individually review each case of returning citizen FTFs, their spouses, and their children.Both federal and state-level law enforcement agencies conduct CT investigations.  They are coordinated through the Joint Counter-Terrorism Center, consisting of 40 internal law enforcement and security agencies.  In 2019, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office opened 590 new terrorism investigations.  Law enforcement agencies significantly increased the number of Gefährder (dangerous persons) deported in 2019, but federal statistics are not yet available.  Germany continued to participate in international efforts to enhance border security.  It adopted legislation to collect and analyze PNR data under EU law, though there is currently a legal challenge to the storage of this data.Significant law enforcement actions in 2019 included:In November, the court began a trial against a German soldier who posed as a Syrian refugee to orchestrate a terror attack against politicians in hopes of framing Islamist extremists.The government dedicated increased resources to combating REMT, including risk assessment systems and online monitoring tools.  The Federal Criminal Police Office will hire hundreds of new staff to work on this threat.Germany continued to examine the circumstances that led to the December 19, 2016, Christmas Market terror attack.  The Bundestag and two state parliaments (North-Rhine Westphalia and Berlin) continued to conduct hearings to evaluate law enforcement’s performance in the case, including law enforcement coordination among different agencies and states, and police practices.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Germany is a member of the FATF.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit Germany, is a member of the Egmont Group.  The FIU is working to eliminate a backlog of cases and will undergo a FATF Mutual Evaluation Report in 2020.  Germany is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.The North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) Task Force against Terror Financing, Organized Crime, and Money Laundering and the Düsseldorf public prosecutor executed 62 search warrants across NRW and coordinated raids in Baden-Württemberg, Berlin, Hamburg, Hesse, and the Netherlands on November 18.The Federal Criminal Police and Europol assisted Spanish law enforcement with uncovering a 71-year-old Iraqi-born Spanish citizen who was funding the return of ISIS fighters to Europe through a hawala system of remittances.  Spanish authorities arrested the perpetrator in November 2019, though investigations are ongoing.   Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, Germany maintained funding for existing countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment programs and earmarked a total of $255 million for programs that target all types of terrorism, including a $118 million National Prevention Strategy Against Islamist Extremism and special programs concerning returning FTFs and their families.  The majority of programs are federally funded, led jointly by the Federal Interior and Family Ministries, and implemented locally through the states and NGOs.  The program focuses on local communities, schools, and refugee integration centers giving special attention to prevention and de-radicalization through the internet, refugee integration, and prisons.  These programs have mandatory evaluation requirements and local research institutions have begun to engage in research related to countering radicalization and recruitment.  The federal government announced it will continue its funding for preventing “extremism” in the 2020 budget plan.The federal “Live Democracy!” program is a cornerstone of the government’s strategy to counter terrorist radicalization, prevent enmity against people, and promote democracy.  The government allocated approximately $127 million for related projects in Germany.  The German cities of Augsburg, Berlin, Dresden, and Düsseldorf are members of the SCN.  In 2019, the cities of Bonn, Cologne, and Dusseldorf participated in a City Pair exchange with U.S. cities Anaheim and San Diego.International and Regional Cooperation:  In 2019, Germany assumed co-leadership of the GCTF West Africa Working Group.  The United States and Germany were co-leaders of the GCTF “Initiative to Counter Unmanned Aerial System Threats,” which led to the Berlin Memorandum on Good Practices for Countering Terrorist Use of Unmanned Aerial Systems, endorsed at the Tenth GCTF Ministerial Plenary Meeting in New York in September 2019.  Germany remains an active participant in other GCTF initiatives.  In May 2019, Germany organized a workshop, Strengthening Capacities to Prevent and Counter Terrorism by Enhancing Cross-Border Collaboration and Information Exchange on Foreign Terrorist Fighters Between Law Enforcement Agencies, under the auspices of the GCTF FTF Working Group.  Germany also cooperates with other OSCE-participating states in the fight against terrorism.The Greek government remained a collaborative CT partner in 2019.  The Greek Parliament passed legislation to criminalize terrorist travel and the provision of material support to terrorists.  Following Greece’s first comprehensive national assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing in 2018, the FATF upgraded Greece’s standing in 2019.  Greece continued to vet irregular migrants arriving in significant numbers.  Greece worked toward implementing its PNR law to screen air passengers in accordance with international standards.  There were no major terrorist incidents in Greece in 2019; however, domestic groups carried out intermittent small-scale attacks.  Greece is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were intermittent domestic terrorist incidents in 2019:On March 22, two unidentified perpetrators on a motorcycle threw a grenade that exploded in front of a police guard booth outside the consular section of the Russian Embassy resulting in minor damage.  A group called FAI/IRF Revenge Cell Mikhail Zhlobitski later claimed responsibility for the attack on an anti-establishment website.On November 1, approximately 10 perpetrators broke into the offices of far-right political party Golden Dawn and set off an improvised explosive device that caused a fire and material damages.  No organization has claimed responsibility for this attack.Greece experienced small-scale disturbances conducted primarily by domestic anarchists often acting in solidarity with incarcerated terrorists.  Examples of these incidents included vandalizing government buildings, private residences of Greek politicians, and foreign missions with paint and leaflets.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  On November 13, the Greek Parliament passed changes to the penal code to increase penalties for some terrorist acts and to adopt elements of EU Directive 2017/541 criminalizing terrorist travel, training, and the provision of material support.  Greece’s law enforcement and border security officials used watchlists, databases, and biometrics to detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism.  Greece is working toward implementing its 2018 PNR law to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute terrorist offenses and serious crime.Greek authorities arrested domestic and international terrorists, including:In May, Greek officials arrested an Iraqi national pursuant to a European arrest warrant issued by German authorities, charging the individual with terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes against humanity.  Greece extradited the individual to Germany in September.In November, Hellenic Police launched a large-scale operation, uncovering a cache of weapons, including explosives, and arresting three suspects affiliated with the “Revolutionary Self Defense” domestic terrorist group that was responsible for five attacks since 2014.In December, Hellenic Police found and defused an improvised explosive device placed close to a central Athens police station and a university campus.  Authorities noted the lack of warning message that domestic groups typically send and assessed that the device, described as a nail bomb, was intended to kill and maim.  No one claimed responsibility for the device.Despite objections from the U.S. government and others, convicted terrorist Dimitris Koufontinas was granted furlough from prison at the start of January; his subsequent requests for furlough have been denied.  Koufontinas is serving 11 life sentences plus 25 years for murder and his leadership role in “November 17”, the name of the terrorist group that targeted and assassinated members of the U.S. Mission to Greece, as well as British and Turkish diplomats, Greek politicians, and Greek citizens.The porous nature of Greece’s borders remained a concern as irregular migrants continued to arrive in Greece in significant numbers.  Beginning in the summer of 2019, Greece experienced a sharp increase in such arrivals, with more than 10,000 between September 30 and November 3.  Greece’s national identification card remained extremely vulnerable to alteration and photo substitution; it has not incorporated security features, such as digitized photo and biometrics.  The Greek government committed to address this vulnerability through the introduction of a biometric national identification card in the near future.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Greece is a member of FATF.  Its FIU, the Anti-Money Laundering Counter-Terrorist Financing and Source of Funds Investigation Authority, is a member of the Egmont Group.In September, FATF completed its mutual evaluation of Greece.  The report concluded Greece has the foundations for effective action against money laundering and terrorist financing but needs to improve prosecution of these crimes and focus on risks in the nonfinancial sector.  The FIU inspected more than 2,000 suspicious transactions in 2019 but did not report evidence of terrorist financing in Greece.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no significant changes in Greece’s CVE efforts since the 2018 report.International and Regional Cooperation:  Greece is a member of various international bodies and of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Italy collaborated closely with the United States, the EU, and the UN in its international CT efforts.  Domestically, Italy investigated and prosecuted terrorist suspects within its borders and deported 98 subjects for terrorism-related security reasons in 2019.  Italy is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  As part of the Coalition, Italy was among the top contributors of troops in Iraq, heads the Coalition’s police training sub-group, and leads efforts to train Iraqi police and security forces.  Italy continued to co-chair the Coalition’s CIFG with the United States and Saudi Arabia.  Italy is a Framework nation and the fourth-largest troop contributor to NATO’s Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan.In June, Italian and U.S. authorities cooperated to repatriate one Italian FTF from Syria to face prosecution for terrorism-related crimes in Italy.  Italian authorities are concerned about the risk posed by returning fighters, as well as fighters dislodged from areas formerly under ISIS control in Libya and elsewhere who may try to use migrant flows to reach Italy.  In addition, officials are concerned fighters from the Western Balkans returning to Europe could also pass through Italian territory, given the significant Balkan-origin communities in Italy.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Yemeni national Mahamad Fathe was arrested in Milan September 17 for stabbing a soldier.  Fathe had met with “radicalized” suspects in Germany and fought in the civil war in Yemen.  The detainee’s lawyer requested a psychiatric review, as Fathe told investigators he was suicidal.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Under the auspices of the U.S.-Italy Counterterrorism Working Group (a component of the U.S.-Italy Strategic Dialogue), Italian authorities are working to share best practices on migrant screening.  The Italian government continued to make use of 2005 legislation facilitating the detention of terrorist suspects and expedited procedures for expelling non-citizens suspected of endangering national security.  Italy deported 98 individuals on security grounds in 2019, compared with 126 in 2018.  Prominent arrests and expulsions included:On February 28, Italian authorities arrested Algerian citizen Mourad Sadaoui in Caserta pursuant to an INTERPOL Red Notice requested by Algerian authorities seeking to prosecute him on terrorism charges for having traveled from Algeria to Syria to join ISIS in 2014.  Sadaoui lived in Italy on a work permit from 2003 to 2013.  Italian police told the media Sadaoui was the first ISIS FTF returnee arrested in Italy.On April 13, the Italian Ministry of Interior (MoI) announced the expulsion of Naser Baftija, a 39-year-old Kosovar resident in Cremona, on grounds that he was considered a “threat to the security of the country” because he “sought to radicalize” students attending his classes, as well as the local Muslim population in Mantua and Cremona.On April 17, Italian authorities arrested Islamic convert Giuseppe Frittitta and Moroccan national Ossama Ghafir in Milan and Novara, respectively.  Both Frittitta and Ghafir were charged with terrorism-related offenses, including support for committing crimes of terrorism and self-training in activities for the purpose of terrorism.In September 2019, Italian police arrested eight Tunisians and two Italians in Abruzzo suspected of financing activities linked to Al-Nusra in Syria.  They allegedly used money obtained through tax evasion to finance militant groups in Syria and radical imams in Italy.On November 12, police arrested bank clerk Andrea Chesi and his son Yuri, who were accused of having established a REMT terrorist cell in Sovicille, in the province of Siena, and planning to attack the mosque in Colle Val d’Elsa (Tuscany).  Investigators searched their residences, seizing explosives, pistols, and rifles.On November 28, police detained 19 suspects in Sicily and Northern Italy linked to a REMT group that allegedly sought to build a new Nazi party in Italy.  According to media reports, some of the suspects had weapons, access to explosives, and conducted recruitment activities on social media.  According to police statements to the media, the group was forging links with other REMT groups in the UK and Portugal, and it was in the early stages of planning attacks on the Milan and Rome headquarters of the National Italian Partisans Association, the veterans group of anti-Mussolini resistance fighters in World War II.On December 2, the MoI announced the expulsion of two noncitizens considered a threat to the security of the country, as they had been “seeking to radicalize” the local Muslim population.  According to the MoI, Jounayed Ahmed, a 19-year-old Bangladeshi imam, who is a legal resident in Padua, “sought to radicalize” students attending his religious courses.  A second individual, Mohamed Bendafi, a 24-year-old Moroccan resident in Turin, also was expelled after authorities determined he had posted explicit videos and messages on social media inviting other Muslims to travel to Syria to join jihadist groups.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Italy is a member of the FATF, and its FIU is a member of the Egmont Group.  Italy remained a co-lead of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s Counter-ISIS Finance Group, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, and leads the police training sub-group.  In March 2019, the Head of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) signed an MOU with the Italian Guardia di Finanza (GdF), for the GdF to provide capacity-building cooperation and training to other member states on countering the financing of terrorism.Countering Violent Extremism:  No changes since last year.International and Regional Cooperation:  Italy continued to support CT efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, including NATO, the OSCE, and the GCTF.Italy strengthened its CT capacity building efforts in Libya, focusing on coast guard cooperation, investigative training for law enforcement, and border security measures.  The Italian military continued its training activities in Niger with local security forces in support of the efforts of Nigerien authorities and G5 Sahel member states to strengthen border security, counter illicit trafficking, and combat threats to regional security.Kosovo continued to fight the threat of terrorism through close cooperation with the United States.  Kosovo is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  The Government of Kosovo (GOK) is approaching the end of the timeframe envisaged by its comprehensive CVE strategy and is preparing a new comprehensive strategy and action plan for the incoming government to consider for 2020-2025.On April 20, with U.S. assistance, Kosovo repatriated four suspected FTFs and 106 family members from Syria, becoming one of the first countries to return a large number of civilians from the conflict zone.  Three of the four alleged FTFs were held in pretrial detention, while the fourth, an 18-year-old, was released and will be investigated as a juvenile.  The women and children, following an initial holding period of 72 hours to provide physical and mental health screenings, were returned to their families and communities.  The GOK professionally handled the returns during the initial 72-hour period.  Although the government is operating a Prevention and Reintegration Division within its Ministry of Internal Affairs, limited resources and capacity continue to impede the government’s ability to provide returnees with adequate services and assistance.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Kosovo in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Kosovo’s legislative framework is sufficient to prosecute individuals suspected of committing or supporting terrorist activities, but implementation is lacking, particularly with short sentences, early release from prison, and a lack of post-release supervision.  Kosovo supports the implementation of UNSCR 2396 to counter terrorist travel and is working to implement it in practice.On September 4, the Pristina Basic Court convicted six defendants for planning terrorist attacks in Kosovo, Albania, Belgium, France, and North Macedonia, including planned suicide bombings in Kosovo against KFOR troops, night clubs, and Serb Orthodox churches between December 2017 and June 2018.  The lead defendant was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.  The remaining defendants received lesser, but still significant, sentences.  This case followed months of Kosovo Police and Kosovo Intelligence Agency operations with substantial U.S. investigative and prosecutorial assistance, including the tracking of attempted arms purchases.On November 7, the Special Prosecutor’s Office of Kosovo (SPRK) filed charges in the Pristina Basic Court, Special Department, against the first of the four suspected FTFs who had been repatriated from Syria in April.  Prosecutors and investigators are using battlefield evidence provided by the U.S. interagency on the suspected FTFs and some women.  This first FTF pleaded guilty to participation in a terrorist group and was sentenced to four years in prison, including time served in pretrial detention.  Thanks to his guilty plea, the sentence represented a permissible departure below the minimum sentence under Kosovo law (five years).  A second FTF suspect was indicted on December 10.The Pristina Basic Court in 2019 accepted guilty pleas for participation in a terrorist group from two of the women returnees from Syria, sentencing them each to suspended sentences.  Under the terms of their sentences, the women will avoid time in prison if they do not commit further crimes, regularly check in with KP, and attend mandatory psychotherapy sessions.  In November, similar indictments were filed against four additional women returnees, and three further women were indicted in December.On November 18, the SPRK indicted a Kosovo citizen for incitement to commit a terrorist offense after the individual published open support and praise for the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka via social media.On June 27, President Thaci issued a decree obligating Kosovo security institutions to create a domestic list of persons, groups, and organizations involved in terrorism who would be subject to restrictive measures in the country.  President Thaci stated that until such a list is created domestically, Kosovo security institutions will implement the EU’s list, which includes Hizballah.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Kosovo’s FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Kosovo’s CVE strategy and action plan (2015-2020) provides a five-year roadmap for stemming the growing threat of terrorism through a whole-of-government approach, emphasizing the critical role of local stakeholders and civil society. Implementation has been uneven across government ministries, and challenges continue, owing to a lack of capacity and inadequate resources.  An inter-ministerial working group is drafting a revised strategy on counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment to focus on the reintegration of returnees.The Kosovo Justice Ministry continued its implementation of a corrections program – assisted by U.S. experts – aimed at enhancing the management of terrorists in prison; collecting, analyzing, and sharing prison intelligence within law enforcement; and managing the rehabilitation and eventual reintegration of convicted terrorists.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs Prevention and Reintegration Division is tasked with reintegrating individuals who served time in prison on terrorism charges, FTF returnees, and family members – including through funding mental health treatment and facilitating access to social services – but it suffers from insufficient staffing and resources.Kosovo organizations continued cooperative activities through the Country Support Mechanism under GCERF, a public-private global fund to support local, grassroots counter radicalization and recruitment efforts in at-risk communities.Ferizaj/Urosevac, Gjakove/Djakovica, Gjilan/Gnjilane, Gracanica/e, Hani i Elezit/Elez Han, Kacanik, Mitrovica South, Peje/Pec, Prishtine/Pristina, Prizen, Viti/Vitina, Vushtrri/Vucitrn, and Zvecan are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  The Government of Kosovo worked closely with officials in Albania and North Macedonia to support CT capacity building and regional cooperation.The Netherlands continues to respond effectively to the global terrorist threat in border and transportation security, counterterrorist financing, CVE, and bilateral and multilateral CT cooperation.  On December 9, the Dutch lowered their national threat level from “substantial” (Level 4 of 5), where it had been since 2013, to “significant” (Level 3).  The main threat is Islamist terrorism, followed by REMT (which the Dutch refer to as violent “right-wing extremism” or “right-wing terrorism”).  The Dutch assess the threat of REMT violence as less acute in the Netherlands than in other European countries.  The Netherlands has a comprehensive national CT strategy that implements policies to counter all forms of terrorism at the local level through multidisciplinary interagency cooperation.The Netherlands is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, participates in Coalition working groups, and is co-chair of the Coalition’s FTF Working Group with Turkey and Kuwait.  The Netherlands has liaisons embedded at various operational command centers, provided force protection, and contributed military personnel and trainers in Iraq.  The Dutch do not contribute troops or aid in Syria.  The Netherlands is a member of the GCTF.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  On March 18, a man shot random passengers on a tram in Utrecht, killing four and seriously wounding two.  In a hand-written note left at the scene of the attack and in later police interviews, he cited religious reasons for his actions, including perceived mockery of Islam.  Immediately following the attack, the government briefly raised the threat level to “critical,” the highest level, though only locally to divert resources to the manhunt.  The prosecutor charged the man, Gokmen Tanis, with multiple counts of murder with terrorist intent.  The trial was scheduled to start in March 2020.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Netherlands implemented CT legislation in line with relevant UNSCRs.  There were no significant changes in law enforcement structures, capacity, international cooperation, or border security legislation in 2019.  On September 10, the Second Chamber of Parliament (Lower House) approved draft legislation that would make it a punishable offense to reside in an area controlled by a terrorist organization without prior permission from the government.  The proposal is pending deliberations in the First Chamber of Parliament.On June 17, the Dutch began to implement the EU directive on PNR, which requires airlines to transfer passenger information to the Dutch Passenger Information Unit to be checked against databases and risk profiles.Significant law enforcement and judicial actions related to CT included:On July 23, the district court in The Hague convicted Oussama Achraf Akhlafa, a returned Dutch FTF, for committing a war crime in Syria.  The suspect had his picture taken while posing next to a crucified corpse, thereby degrading the personal dignity of the victim.  The court sentenced the suspect to seven-and-a-half years in prison.On October 14, the district court of Amsterdam convicted 20-year-old Jawed Sultani for stabbing two U.S. tourists in Amsterdam central station on August 31, 2018.  The court convicted him on two counts of attempted murder with terrorist intent and sentenced him to 26 years and 8 months in prison (the maximum under the charges) and a payment of almost $3.5 million in damages to the victims.  Sultani, born in Afghanistan and residing in Germany as an asylum seeker, traveled to the Netherlands for the attack because he believed politician Geert Wilders insulted his religion.On November 18, the district court of The Hague convicted 27-year-old Pakistani national Junaid Iqbal for planning a terrorist attack on politician Geert Wilders and sentenced him to 10 years in prison.  Iqbal traveled to The Hague in August 2018 and posted a video on Facebook threatening to kill Wilders, following Wilders’ announcement of organizing a Muhammed cartoon competition.On November 25, police arrested two men on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack in the Netherlands.  The investigation began in October based on information from the General Security and Intelligence Services that the individuals wanted to learn how to make explosives.  The individuals reportedly told undercover agents they intended to commit a terrorist attack against an unknown target in the Netherlands before the end of the year using car bombs or suicide vests.Returned FTFs undergo a threat assessment by the government; some returnees are prosecuted.  The government does not actively repatriate FTFs and their children from camps in Syria but escorts back those FTFs who report to a Dutch diplomatic mission.  On January 23, the district court in Rotterdam ordered the government to “do everything it can” to ensure that six female former ISIS members, who are currently in Syrian refugee camps, are brought into Dutch custody.  The government announced it would incorporate four other women in similar situations in this effort.  On November 11, a Dutch court ruled that the government must do everything it can, including seeking U.S. assistance, to repatriate 55 children of FTFs.  On November 22, an appellate court overturned this decision.  As of December 1, the women were still in camps in Syria.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The Netherlands is a member of the FATF and is one of the Cooperating and Supporting Nations of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, a FATF-style regional body.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit – Netherlands, is a member of the Egmont Group and contributes to Europol’s financial intelligence team.  The Netherlands is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.In 2019, Dutch courts convicted at least seven persons for financing FTFs in Syria and issued sentences of up to nine months in prison.The Dutch framework for countering the financing of terrorism applies to all EU-designated terrorist organizations and the UN Security Council ISIL (Da’esh) and al-Qa’ida sanctions regime.  As of December 2019, the government’s national terrorist watch lists include 139 individuals and four organizations whose assets were frozen.  Countering Violent Extremism:  The Netherlands’ 2016-2020 National Counterterrorism Strategy contains measures to strengthen communities, build resilience to terrorist radicalization, and prevent persons from becoming FTFs.  The strategy prioritizes prevention, among other themes.  The government uses a local, multidisciplinary approach for prevention and develops tailored plans of action to intervene with individuals suspected of radicalization.Community police officers are the cornerstone of the local approach to prevention.  Other stakeholders include local governments, with the support of the Office of the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism, the public prosecutor’s office, social workers, child protective services, educators, and community leaders.  This approach prioritizes the use of preventive measures, including mentoring, counseling, and access to job-training programs and other social services.  Similar programs also rehabilitate former terrorists.  To counter terrorist messaging, local governments use outreach efforts with community and religious leaders to amplify credible voices.The Dutch cities of The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  The Netherlands participates in the UN, GCTF, the EU, the CoE, the OSCE, and NATO.  The Netherlands handed off its co-chair of the GCTF to Canada on September 23, but the GCTF Administrative Unit remained in The Hague.  The Netherlands is on the governing board of the three GCTF-inspired institutions:  the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism (Hedayah), the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, and GCERF.  The Netherlands also participates in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.The Netherlands continued to finance a wide variety of capacity building projects.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed regional security coordinators at six embassies who are dedicated to capacity building to identify terrorist radicalization.  The Netherlands is an active participant in Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Center and the Counter Terrorism Group (the intelligence services of all EU member states plus Norway and Switzerland) to improve cooperation and information exchange between and among European CT services.North Macedonia cooperated with U.S. CT efforts and was a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  With no terrorist attacks in 2019 and no reported departures of its citizens to join ISIS, the main terrorism threat North Macedonia faced consisted of returned FTFs from Syria and Iraq.  North Macedonia’s authorities assessed that ISIS members and sympathizers maintained a presence in North Macedonia.  The National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Countering Terrorism (NCCVECT) estimated 156 citizens of North Macedonia have traveled to join terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.  Of that number, 36 were killed, 37 remain, and 83 returned to North Macedonia.  The country’s authorities acknowledged an unconfirmed number of family members reside in refugee camps in Syria.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in North Macedonia in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  North Macedonia’s legislative framework is adequate to prosecute individuals and groups suspected of committing or aiding terrorist activities or participating in foreign wars.  Low sentencing for terrorism-related offenses remains a challenge.Six of the seven FTFs repatriated in August 2018 were re-sentenced in November, following the appellate court’s decision to return the case to the first instance court.  They again pleaded guilty to participation in a terrorist organization, and each received the same six-year sentence.  One of the six FTFs continues to contest his remaining charge of membership in a terrorist organization, while the seventh FTF’s case has been severed from the others and is delayed as he receives medical treatment.North Macedonia’s law enforcement capacity to proactively detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism improved because of numerous training sessions.  The Ministry of Interior’s (MOI’s) newly named “Terrorism and Violent Extremism Sector” continued to take the lead in performing law enforcement-related CT functions.  In September, the Agency for National Security replaced the Department for Security and Counterintelligence as a distinct entity separate from the MOI.  Two major units comprise MOI’s “Terrorism” sector – terrorism investigations and explosive ordinance detection and destruction.  In 2019, the U.S. Department of State provided numerous training sessions for law enforcement officers, as well as mentorship, and it donated hardware, software, and crime scene forensic tools to the country’s law enforcement CT partners.  Embassy Skopje supported a “Friendly Patrols” project by mentoring six retired police officers, who trained about 120 active police officers and community members to recognize the early signs of terrorist recruitment and radicalization.North Macedonia continues to enhance its ability to screen for terrorists as part of a comprehensive approach to border security, with support and cooperation from the United States.  In February, North Macedonia committed to implementation of the use of API/PNR data to screen for known or suspected terrorists and/or criminals.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  North Macedonia is a member of MONEYVAL.  North Macedonia’s FIU, the Financial Intelligence Office (FIO), is a member of the Egmont Group.  In 2019, the government adopted necessary bylaws to the Law on Restrictive Measures, including Guidelines for the Implementation of Financial Restrictive Measures Against Terrorism and Proliferation; a decision for establishment of a coordinative body to monitor implementation of restrictive measures; and a rulebook on maintaining a list of designated persons against whom financial measures for terrorism have been introduced.  The FIO, in cooperation with the NCCVECT, prepared guidance for NGOs regarding their exposure risk to terrorism financing.  The Council for AML/CFT gathered about 100 representatives from the public and private sectors to update the National Risk Assessment (NRA), using World Bank methodology.  The updated NRA and accompanying Action Plan are with the government, awaiting endorsement and then parliamentary approval.  Jordan provided the FIO with grant funding to upgrade its software for the exchange of data on designated individuals and entities of terrorism financing concern.  The FIO received six suspicious transaction reports for terrorist financing in 2019 and submitted them to relevant institutions for further processing.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government continued to implement the action plan associated with the National CVE Strategy, adopted in March 2018.  The NCCVECT assessed the level of implementation as “satisfactory.”  In partnership with the OSCE, the NCCVECT organized a series of roundtables across the country to raise awareness around the national CT and CVE strategies and action plans.  The NCCVECT assisted the multi-stakeholder Community Action Teams established in Kichevo, Gostivar, and Cair (a municipality in the capital city of Skopje), to develop and implement their Action Plans focused on preventing terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  With support from the SCN, Kumanovo also established a Community Action Team in September.  The municipalities of Aracinovo, Cair, Gostivar, Kicevo, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Struga, and Tetovo are members of the SCN.In conjunction with international donors, the NCCVECT supported numerous projects focused on recognizing the “early signs of radicalization and building community resilience to terrorist ideas” by training and engaging youth, parents, educators, and law enforcement officers.  Among other initiatives, with funding from the U.S. Department of State’s CT Bureau, the United States supported the NCCVECT through an imbedded expert on countering radicalization and recruitment, and it supported the Women Without Borders’ Mothers’ Circles program to expand to three additional municipalities.  A UK-funded project engaged the family members of convicted terrorism offenders to provide a clearer picture of the challenges these families face and the social assistance needed.  The International Organization for Migration is using this analysis to help inform its new program focused on reintegration.  Despite these nascent efforts, North Macedonia currently has no reintegration and rehabilitation programs in place, and no humanitarian aid programs are underway to assist returnees.International and Regional Cooperation:  Since the NCCVECT was established in 2017, it has focused on increasing regional cooperation.  In 2019, North Macedonia cooperated with other Western Balkan countries on critical infrastructure protection, prison radicalization and the tools available to counter it, and the repatriation of FTFs and their family members.  North Macedonia initiated closer cooperation with regional countries’ intelligence agencies to share CT-relevant information.  With EU support, North Macedonia adopted and signed a Joint CT Action Plan among Western Balkan countries, part of the Western Balkans Six initiative.Norway and the United States maintained good collaboration on CT.  Norway’s Police Security Service (PST) continued to assess that individuals and groups inspired by “extreme Islamist groups” represented the most significant terrorist threat to Norway.  Norway saw an increased level of mobilization and recruitment among REMT groups, which it calls “right wing extremist groups.”  The PST reintroduced a five-level scale to describe the national terror threat level and set the risk level at 3, which indicates a moderate chance of a terrorist attack taking place.Norway is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  The government co-sponsored UNSCRs 2178 and 2396 and contributed to the Coalition’s five lines of effort, including military personnel support to a capacity-building mission for Iraqi security forces in Anbar, Iraq.  In 2019, Norway provided country specific funding of approximately US $334 million to address the humanitarian crises in Iraq and Syria.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  In August, Philip Manshaus attempted to commit a mass shooting at an Islamic center in a municipality neighboring the capital, Oslo.  He entered the mosque when few people were present and was overpowered by a member before being apprehended by police.  He is being investigated for terrorism and the murder of his stepsister and is in pretrial detention.  The investigation revealed he was active in online forums for white supremacists and inspired by the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Following this attack, PST updated its assessment of the likelihood of “right-wing extremists” attempting to carry out terrorist attacks from “unlikely” to “possible.”Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Terrorism is a criminal offense in Norway, and it is illegal to conduct or plan to conduct a terrorist attack, receive terrorism-related training, or provide material support to a terrorist organization.  In addition, it is a criminal offense to travel or intend to travel to fight on behalf of a terrorist organization.  The maximum prison sentence for serious terrorism offenses is 30 years.Norway continued to prosecute individuals for terrorism-related offenses.  In separate cases, a Norwegian court convicted a woman of attempting to join a terrorist organization and a man of participating in a terrorist organization.  The woman received a prison sentence of two years and nine months, and the man received seven years and three months.  In at least one instance, Norwegian officials used the Immigration Act to arrest a white supremacist on the grounds that he could influence others to commit violence.The Norwegian government changed the Immigration Directorate’s guidance so that those possessing or seeking residence permits who have spent time in ISIS-controlled areas or have some affiliation with ISIS or other terrorist networks in Syria and Iraq may have their permits revoked and shall have their applications denied, to the extent consistent with the Norwegian Constitution and International Law.The PST is responsible for domestic security, including CT activities.  The Joint Counter Terrorism Center, a joint analysis cell, includes participants from the PST and the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), the external security service.  Both PST and NIS have devoted significant resources to identifying, tracking, and taking action against Norwegian citizens intending to travel to and from Syria or Iraq to fight for terrorist groups.Norway shares fingerprint information in criminal investigations with the EU and the parties to the Prüm Convention.  Norway continued to explore an agreement on sharing PNR data with the EU and is simultaneously developing a national PNR system, which remained in the pilot phase at the end of 2019.  Immigration to Norway is facilitated and regulated by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, which processes all applications for asylum, visas, family immigration, work and study permits, permanent residence, and travel documents.  The Norwegian Immigration Database serves as a central repository for immigration authorities and contains biographic data and facial photos for all applicants for admission.  The Norwegian police and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issue passports that, since 2005, have contained biometric data accessible for review by border security officials.  Norway coordinates with INTERPOL and Europol to enhance its vetting processes and has access to the Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System to share and receive information regarding suspected terrorists.Security measures to protect soft targets in Oslo include physical barriers in the streets of one of the city’s main pedestrian thoroughfares and directly outside the neighboring buildings.  Measures may be enhanced for specific events.  Police at Oslo’s Gardermoen Airport are armed on a permanent basis.  The government and its underlying agencies continued to implement measures to secure public infrastructure, such as government and defense facilities, against potential terrorist attacks.  This followed criticism for slow progress by the National Auditor in 2018.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Norway is a member of the FATF.  Norway’s FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit Norway, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Norway is a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Norway continued to implement its National Action Plan against Radicalization and Violent Extremism, published in 2014, which is a whole-of government approach to countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  Priorities include strengthening CVE research, improving national and local cooperation on counter-radicalization efforts, promoting the reintegration of former terrorists, and preventing online recruitment and radicalization.  The plan is dynamic and is reviewed regularly with all stakeholders to ensure continued effectiveness.  A review process begun in 2019 has been particularly comprehensive because of changes in the threat environment.Norway coordinates among authorities responsible for managing the release from prison and reintegration of those convicted of terrorism-related offenses.  Municipalities considered home to populations and individuals most vulnerable to terrorist radicalization have created action plans for prevention activities.  The national government hosts an annual conference on terrorist radicalization, which in 2019 focused in part on racially or ethnically motivated terrorism.Norway supports the Youth Civil Activism Network.  Oslo and Kristiansand are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Norway is active in multilateral fora in efforts to counter terrorism, including NATO, the EU’s Radicalization Awareness Network, and the OSCE.  In 2019, the OSCE launched a Norwegian-funded handbook on gender perspectives in countering violent extremism and radicalization.  Norway provided financial support to the GCTF Working Group on Capacity-Building in East Africa, supported INTERPOL’s capacity-building programs on border security and rule of law in North Africa and the Sahel, and funded counter-radicalization programs in prisons in Kenya, Indonesia, and Morocco.  Norway supports implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism and is co-chair with Jordan of the Group of Friends at the UN on preventing violent extremism.  Norway is contributing $1.2 million to the UNOCT for the 2018-2021 period, in partnership with UNDP.  Norway provides funding for the International Civil Society Action Network and in 2019 hosted the eighth annual Women, Peace and Security forum, which focused on situational and trends analysis regarding the threat of terrorism and conflict.  Norway supports the GCERF.The Russian Federation continued to prioritize CT efforts in 2019 and remained a target of international terrorist groups, particularly ISIS.  Low-level militant terrorist activity remained a problem in Russia’s North Caucasus region despite increases in CT activities and political consolidation efforts.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  On January 11, three apparent terrorists attacked officers of Russia’s road patrol service near the village of Agachaul, Karabudakhentsky District in the Republic of Dagestan.  The suspects opened fired on law enforcement officers with automatic rifles before being killed by the authorities.  The authorities reportedly found additional weapons and ammunition in the suspects’ car.  Additional attacks included:On March 13, two suspects in the Shpakov district in Stavropol opened fire with automatic weapons and threw a grenade when stopped by the Federal Security Service (FSB) for questioning.  The suspects were killed onsite.  Russian authorities reported the perpetrators were affiliated with ISIS and had been planning a terrorist attack.On April 8, there was an explosion at Kolomna, near Moscow.  ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attack, which reportedly did not result in any casualties.On July 1, a man killed a police officer with a knife at a checkpoint in the Achkhoy-Martonovsky district of Chechnya.  The police shot and killed the attacker as he threw a grenade at them.  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.On December 19, a Moscow region resident opened fire near the FSB headquarters in Moscow and killed two security officers and wounded four others.  The shooter was killed onsite.  The attacker was later identified as Yevgeny Manyurov, a 39-year-old former security guard.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Under the coordination of the National Antiterrorism Committee and with aid from the Ministry of Internal Affairs when appropriate, the FSB performs CT functions.  Russia increasingly used its counterterrorism and anti-extremism legislation against the political opposition, independent media, and certain religious organizations, including Jehovah’s Witnesses, to criminalize the exercise of freedoms of religion or belief, expression, and association.Russia’s FSB Director General Alexander Bortnikov reported in late September that the FSB had identified terrorist cells in 17 regions of the country.  He stated that Russian law enforcement had prevented 39 terrorist attacks, killed 32 militants, detained 679 suspects, and dismantled 49 terrorists’ cells that were plotting attacks.  Notwithstanding those incidents, Bortnikov stated on December 10 that the intelligence services did not allow any terrorist acts in 2019 despite the incidents listed.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that those detained in connection to terrorism in 2019 included 14 returning international terrorists.On November 5, Russian media reported the arrest of a 30-year-old native of Kyrgyz Republic for planning a terrorist attack in Moscow.  Media reported the suspect, who confessed to planning an explosion in a crowded area of the nation’s capital, was affiliated with a “radical form of Islam.”Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Russia is a member of FATF and two FATF-style regional bodies:  MONEYVAL and EAG.  Its FIU, the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring), is a member of the Egmont Group.In September, Rosfinmonitoring released for public discussion a draft law to amend Article 6.2 of the federal law “On the Prevention of Criminal Proceeds Legalization and Terrorist Financing.”  The amendment would establish that legal entities are required to take reasonable measures in specific circumstances to prevent the laundering of criminal proceeds and to cooperate with law enforcement agencies on issues related to combating terrorist financing and money laundering.In December, FATF published a Mutual Evaluation Report that reviewed Russia’s compliance with FATF standards and the effectiveness of Russia’s AML/CFT system.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government has not committed great attention to countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment in 2019.  However, according to NGO reports, Russian government authorities, including the Ministry of Internal Affair’s Center for Countering Extremism and the FSB, continue to misuse the country’s expansive definition of extremism to curtail freedoms of expression, belief, assembly, and association.International and Regional Cooperation:  Russia participated in several joint CT exercises, including the Tsentr 2019 exercise from September 16 to 21, with China, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.  Russia also promoted the Collective Security Treaty Organization as a forum for international CT cooperation and conducted the Combat Brotherhood-2019 exercise from October 21 to 29.  Russia is a member of the GCTF and an active participant in several multilateral organizations, including the UN, OSCE, the East Asia Summit, APEC, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the ASEAN Regional Forum.  On September 5 and 6, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized the International Conference on Countering Illicit Trafficking in Arms in the Context of Fighting International Terrorism.  Russia also hosted the 18th Meeting of Heads of Special Services, Security Agencies, and Law-Enforcement Organizations in Sochi on October 16 and 17.With no terrorist attacks in 2019 and low levels of ISIS recruitment activities, the main terrorism concerns in Serbia remain the potential movement of money and weapons through the region, recruitment and return of FTFs, the revitalization of terrorist ideologies, and opportunities for self-radicalization to terrorism, including racially and ethnically motivated terrorism.  Serbia has built on its efforts to counter terrorism and continues cooperation with the United States and international partners.  Serbia is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Serbia in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Serbia’s criminal code criminalizes terrorism-related offenses, including international terrorism, incitement, recruitment, using a deadly device, destruction and damage to a nuclear facility, terrorist financing, and terrorist association.  The criminal code also outlaws unauthorized participation in a war or armed conflict in a foreign country and prescribes incarceration from six months to eight years, with penalties increased to 10 years for citizens who organize, train, or fund a foreign armed conflict.  Although UNSCR 2396 mandates that member states develop systems to screen PNR data, currently API and PNR screening programs are not in place in Serbia.  Serbia’s Civil Aviation Directorate is integrating with the European Common Aviation Area and cooperates with international partners to enhance capacities in accordance with UNSCR 2309.Amendments to the criminal code passed in May 2019 have criminalized travel abroad to prepare for, train for, plan, or participate in the commission of terrorist acts.  The amendments expand the criminal offense of terrorist financing by, among other things, specifying direct or indirect fundraising or funds collection for the purpose of financing the commission of terrorist acts.  The amendments also introduce a sentence of life imprisonment for the most serious forms of terrorism.There has been no change to the way the courts address terrorism.  Current legislation stipulates that the Belgrade Higher Court’s Special Department for Organized Crime hears terrorism-related offenses and the Organized Crime Prosecutor’s Office prosecutes them.  The Belgrade Appellate Court’s Special Department for Organized Crime hears appeals.Serbia’s law enforcement capacities need improvement but are progressing.  The Criminal Police Directorate’s Service for Combating Terrorism and Extremism (TES) works on terrorism detection, deterrence, and prevention.  Serbia’s Operational Working Group consists of TES, the Security Information Agency, and the Prosecutor’s Office.  Soft targets are required to have terrorism contingency plans, with TES officers providing consultation and oversight.The Serbian Border Police’s System to Check Persons and Vehicles (SZPLIV) screens passengers and vehicles at all border crossings and other ports of entry.  SZPLIV verifies the validity of travel documents through basic indicative security elements, collects biographic and biometric data, checks visa status, searches national and international databases, and stores the information.  However, data transmission to the central system can take days.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Serbia is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF-style regional body, and has observer status in the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG).  Its FIU, the Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering, is a member of the Egmont Group.In June, the FATF removed Serbia from monitoring under FATF’s ongoing global AML/CFT compliance process, commonly referred to as the FATF “grey list.”  In October, the Government of Serbia proposed legislative amendments to the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism to further align Serbia’s existing AML/CFT regime with recommendations of MONEYVAL and the EU’s Fifth AML Directive.  In December, Serbia opened Chapter 4 of the EU acquis (Free Movement of Capital), which will require Serbia to complete further legislative alignment with the acquis and international standards, as well as demonstrate, through a track record, an improved administrative capacity to implement and enforce AML and CFT legislation.Countering Violent Extremism:  Serbia is implementing its National Strategy for the Prevention and Countering of Terrorism for the Period 2017-2021 and accompanying Action Plan, which seeks to identify early factors leading to terrorist radicalization, enhance the security of its citizens, and intercept threats from social media activities.  The Serbian intergovernmental CT working group meets regularly.  In 2019, Serbia appointed the director of police at the Ministry of Interior as the national coordinator for countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  The government took some steps to counter violence against minorities.Bujanovac, Novi Pazar, Preševo, and Tutin are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Serbia is engaged in some regional and international cooperation on CT issues.  The Ministry of the Interior and the Security Information Agency cooperate with INTERPOL and Europol on CT activities, including watchlists.  In 2019, INTERPOL issued red notices at Serbia’s request for three FTFs who are Serbian citizens.  Serbia, a participant in NATO’s Partnership for Peace, assisted in NATO training of Iraqi military medical personnel as part of counterterrorism efforts and routinely participates in international law enforcement training.  Police officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs participated in training or study visits, including to the Special Task Force in Rome, which is part of the Italian Carabinieri, as well as to the Europol Referral Unit in The Hague.In 2019 the OSCE deployed a mobile training team (represented by border officers from BiH, Greece, North Macedonia, the United States, and INTERPOL) in Belgrade to deliver interactive training on the identification of FTFs for Serbian border officials.  Sessions included training on employing API and PNR systems and travel document security.Serbia has well-developed bilateral border security cooperation programs with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, and a Tri-Border partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.  Serbian law enforcement agencies routinely engage with Albania, North Macedonia, and Montenegro.Spain remained on “high” national alert for terrorism throughout 2019 for the fifth year in a row, and Spanish authorities continued to arrest individuals suspected of planning terror attacks; facilitating terrorist financing; and engaging in ISIS- and al-Qa’ida-related recruitment and radicalization, both online and in their communities.  Spanish CT cooperation with the United States was excellent.  Spain maintained its contribution to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, with up to 550 personnel deployed to Iraq throughout the year in military and police training missions.  Spain continued to exercise leadership in regional and global CT fora, including the GCTF and the 5+5 Defense Initiative.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no known terrorist incidents reported in Spain during the year.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Spanish government published its first National Strategy Against Terrorism to unify and update its strategy to prevent, combat, and counteract terrorist threats, replacing the 2012 Comprehensive Strategy Against International Terrorism and Radicalization.  The Ministry of Interior, through the Center for Intelligence against Terrorism and Organized Crime (CITCO), with contributions from the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Justice, developed the document to align with the Counter-Terrorism Strategies of the EU and the UN with four pillars:  Prevent, Protect, Pursue, and Prepare the response.  The strategy is in force for four years.The Spanish criminal code punishes any act of “collaboration with the activities or purposes of a terrorist organization,” including promotion of terrorism on social media, self-radicalization on the internet, training remotely, operating without clear affiliation, or traveling in support of nonstate terrorist actors.  As of November 2019, Spanish authorities reported that police had undertaken 32 cunterterrorist operations and detained 58 suspects for the year.  Significant law enforcement actions related to CT included:On February 4, the Spanish Ministry of Interior announced the breakup of a terrorist network in Spanish prisons, led by five Moroccan nationals who sought to recruit other prisoners to pledge allegiance to ISIS.  The five suspects, ranging in age from 25 to 68, had been serving sentences since 2013 and are believed to have been radicalized in prison.  A prison official who allegedly took bribes from the network was also arrested, along with a man and woman in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcón who allegedly provided the network with material support.  The suspects threatened and harassed other prisoners for diverging from religious orthodoxy and directly instructed other prisoners to commit acts of terrorism.  They claimed to be in contact with ISIS leaders who could facilitate financial compensation to the prisoners’ families in exchange for conducting attacks.On September 23, Spanish Civil Guard agents arrested nine individuals for allegedly stockpiling explosive precursors and planning to commit violence on or around the anniversary of the October 1, 2017, illegal Catalan independence referendum, and/or in response to the conviction and sentencing of jailed pro-independence leaders.  Authorities eventually charged seven of those arrested with membership in a terrorist organization, manufacture and possession of explosives, and conspiracy to commit mayhem.  The investigating court subsequently released several of the accused on bail because they were not primary actors in the conspiracy.On October 8, Spanish Police arrested a 23-year-old Spanish citizen of Moroccan origin for alleged membership in ISIS.  He was allegedly the coordinator in Spain of Muntasir Media, an unofficial platform for disseminating propaganda supporting ISIS and promoting terrorism.  Officials found chemical precursors for explosives at his residence along with instructions for making bombs.  He had also assembled lists of possible targets for attack.  Authorities charged him with advocating terrorism and making terrorist threats.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Spain is a member of the FATF and has observer or cooperator status in the following FATF-style regional bodies:  the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT), and the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF).  Spain maintained funding levels for its FIU, the Executive Service for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Monetary Offenses, which is a member of the Egmont Group.  Spain is a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.The Spanish government has proposed automatically applying future UNSC terrorism financing sanctions in Spain, rather than awaiting the transposition of the sanctions by the EU.  On June 18, the Spanish National Police, in collaboration with Europol, arrested 10 suspects of Syrian origin as part of a large CT financing operation involving 350 agents across Madrid, Toledo, and Valencia.  The accused allegedly had links to al-Qa’ida operatives in Syria and were detained for belonging to a criminal organization, collaborating with a terrorist organization, terrorist financing, money laundering, tax fraud, document falsification, and facilitating illegal immigration.Countering Violent Extremism:  Spain continued implementation of its national CVE plan, developed in 2015 and led by CITCO.  It identifies potential for terrorist radicalization and recruitment down to census district level using an algorithm based in socioeconomic factors and seeks to build partnerships at the local level between civil society leaders from vulnerable communities and representatives of law enforcement and other public services.  While Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska had announced an effort to “revamp” the plan in October 2018, no amended version has yet been issued publicly.  According to the plan, Barcelona is considered the highest risk area for jihadist terrorist activity, though police made more terrorism- related arrests near Madrid (23 versus seven in Barcelona) than any other city.  The Spanish cities of Fuenlabrada and Malaga are both members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Spain is a founding member of the GCTF and supports CT initiatives in the UN, CoE, NATO, and OSCE.  Spain maintained forces throughout 2019 in EU training missions in Mali and Somalia.  Spain continues to support the 5+5 Defense Initiative bringing together European (France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain) and North African (Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia) countries to build capacity on CT, maritime and aviation security, and disaster management.  Spain cooperated with regional partners on CT investigations and arrests.There were no terrorist attacks in 2019.  The Swedish Security Service annual report stated “the [terrorist] threat remains largely at the same level as a year ago, although very few individuals are likely to have the intent to carry out attacks in Sweden.”  The report further stated the threat to Sweden from “Islamist-motivated actors” had not changed significantly from last year; however, “xenophobic and white supremacist groups” were increasing in size and collaborating more frequently with one another.  At the end of 2019, the national alert level remained Level 3 (elevated threat, no evidence of planning) on a scale of 5 (attack imminent, evidence of planning).The government continued efforts to strengthen its CT framework.  In October, the government proposed draft legislation that would criminalize collaboration with terrorist organizations and another draft law that would authorize law enforcement access to encrypted data on computers and mobile devices.  Parliament will debate the laws in 2020.  In November, the Terrorist Investigation Commission completed its systematic review of criminal laws pertaining to terrorism.  The report proposed that the government draft a comprehensive, updated terrorism law to replace the existing patchwork of laws.Sweden is a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition.  In addition to being a leader in humanitarian support to ISIS-affected communities, Sweden deployed 70 military trainers to Iraq in support of Defeat-ISIS efforts.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Sweden in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In April, new legislation gave the Swedish Coast Guard increased authorities for maritime law enforcement.  The new law also extended the Coast Guard’s mandate to include support for the National Police in its efforts to combat crime and strengthen national security.In August, the terrorism trial that had begun in December 2018 of five Uzbek and one Kyrgyz nationals concluded.  All six defendants were convicted of terrorism financing but then released for time served.  The prosecution requested expulsion in all cases, but the Migration Court of Appeal ruled that current conditions in the defendants’ home countries made it impossible to deport them.  In October, the government requested the deportation of six “radical” imams who had been detained by the Swedish Security Service.  The Migration Court of Appeal ruled the men could not be deported as they risked persecution in their home countries.Sweden is party to the EU’s identity verification and border management tools such as the Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System.  Sweden collects and uses API, and some PNR, and exchanges information with other members states on irregular immigration and border control.  The EU PNR directive came into force on August 1, 2018.  Sweden used the “serious threat to public policy or internal security” justification permitted under the Schengen Border Code to unilaterally prolong the temporary border controls first introduced in 2015 in response to the massive influx of asylum seekers until May 12, 2020.  Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Sweden is a member of FATF.  Its FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Service, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There have been no changes since 2018.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The National Center for Preventing Violent Extremism under the Ministry of Justice coordinated efforts among government ministries, local municipalities, and civil society organizations to share risk assessments, action plans, best practices, and lessons learned.  Malmo and Stockholm are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Sweden is a member of the EU and supports CT efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, including the European Commission’s Radicalization Awareness Network, the EU-9 (focusing on FTFs), the Counter-Terrorism Group, the Police Working Group on Terrorism, and Europol.Sweden funded international CT capacity building projects through development assistance from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), funding to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime-Terrorism Prevention Branch, and funding to the OSCE.  Sweden supported the EU’s work with capacity-building projects in prioritized countries and regions, such as Pakistan, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, the Maghreb, and the Sahel.Sweden provided 200 trainers to the UN MINUSMA and recently extended the mission through 2020.  Sweden participated in the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan with 25 service members and recently extended the mission through 2020.  Sweden was a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition and made humanitarian contributions to ISIS-affected populations in Iraq in addition to development aid funding to Iraq ($105 million for 2017-2021).  Sweden extended its deployment of 70 military trainers in Iraq in support of Coalition efforts until the end of 2020.  Sweden contributed humanitarian support for northern Syria ($52 million since the beginning of the year).  Since 2016, Sweden also implemented a regional crisis strategy for Syria ($190 million) that included resilience support for groups affected by ISIS’s progress.  On October 17, the government announced an additional $10.5 million for further efforts in northeast Syria.Turkey continued its efforts to defeat terrorist organizations both inside and outside its borders, including the PKK and ISIS.  Turkey remained an active contributor in international CT fora, including the GCTF.Turkey is a source and transit country for FTFs seeking to join ISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq.  Turkey is an active member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, co-chairs the Defeat-ISIS Coalition FTF Working Group, and continued to provide access to its airspace and facilities for Coalition CT operations in Iraq and Syria.  According to public data, as of November, Turkey’s “Banned From Entry List” included about 76,000 individuals.  Since 2011, Turkey has repatriated more than 7,800 FTFs from more than 100 countries.  As part of a new push to return suspected ISIS members and family members to their home countries, between mid-November and early-December 2019, the Turkish government deported or denied entry for more than 70 individuals for alleged terrorism. The Ministry of Interior reported that, as of December 9, there were 1,174 ISIS members and 115 al-Qa’ida members in Turkish custody.The PKK continued to conduct terrorist attacks in Turkey and against Turkish interests outside of Turkey.  Turkey’s security forces conducted operations domestically along with military operations in northern Iraq and northern Syria.  International Crisis Group, an NGO, assessed that, in the first 11 months of the year, 26 civilians, 82 security force members, and 343 PKK militants were killed in Turkey’s eastern and southeastern provinces in PKK-related incidents.  Detentions and arrests of individuals suspected of aiding or having sympathies toward the PKK, including some elected politicians, continued in 2019.  The government continued to restrict some freedoms and elements of the country’s rule of law system under broad counterterrorism legislation.  Prosecutors used a broad definition of terrorism and threats to national security to file criminal charges against and prosecute a broad range of individuals, including journalists, opposition politicians, activists, and others critical of the government.Two Turkish National Intelligence Organization (Milli Istihbarat Teskilatı) officers who were kidnapped in 2017 by the PKK in northern Iraq, remained missing at year’s end.  In July, attackers presumed to be part of the PKK assassinated a Turkish diplomat in a café in Erbil, Iraq.  As a CT partner of the United States, Turkey received U.S. assistance to address the terrorist threat posed by the PKK in 2019.In the aftermath of the July 2016 coup attempt, the Turkish government labeled the movement of self-exiled Fethullah Gulen as the “Fethullah Terrorist Organization” (“FETO”).  “FETO” is not a designated terrorist organization in the United States.  The government continued to detain and arrest Turkish citizens, as well as foreign citizens resident in Turkey – including U.S. citizens and locally employed staff at the U.S. Mission to Turkey – for alleged “FETO” or terrorism-related links, often on the basis of scant evidence and minimal due process.  The government also regularly sought to extradite Turkish citizens resident abroad on terrorism related charges to prosecute them at home for alleged links to “FETO.”  The government also continued to dismiss military, security, and civil servants from public office in 2019.  Since the 2016 failed coup attempt, the government has dismissed or suspended more than 130,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces from public office, arrested or imprisoned more than 80,000 citizens, and closed more than 1,500 NGOs for alleged “FETO” links.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Several terrorist incidents occurred in 2019:On July 5, a roadside bomb struck a car in Reyhanli, killing both passengers and a bystander.  All three were reportedly Syrian citizens.On September 12, a roadside bomb struck a bus carrying workers from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, killing seven and wounding 13 in Diyarbakir province’s Kulp district.  The government blamed the PKK for the attack.On September 25, an IED targeting a police transport van exploded in Adana, wounding five.  The government blamed the banned Marxist-Leninist Communist Party for the attack.In October, during Turkey’s military Operation Peace Spring into Syria against the People’s Protection Units (YPG), 13 civilians in Turkey were killed by cross-border shelling from Syria; the Turkish government attributed these to the YPG, which Turkey considers the Syrian arm of the PKK, a designated FTO.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Turkey has a broad definition of terrorism that includes crimes against constitutional order and internal and external security of the state.  The law criminalizes expression that justifies, praises, or incites persons to use coercion or violent methods used by a terrorist organization.  The government regularly invoked the law to criminalize the exercise of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and other human rights.  According to the Ministry of Interior, authorities referred more than 10,000 social media accounts to judicial authorities for alleged terrorist-related propaganda in the first quarter of the year alone, with more than 3,600 users facing legal action for their social media activities.  Turkey has advanced law enforcement capacity to combat terrorism, and efforts continue to streamline interagency information sharing.The government announced in October that Turkey would take custody of ISIS members and their families in Turkish-controlled areas within Syria.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it would work with countries of origin and international organizations to rehabilitate spouses and children who had not been involved in crimes and would support efforts by countries of origin to repatriate, prosecute, and rehabilitate all FTFs in Syria and their families members.   Turkey sometimes deports suspected FTFs without providing advance notice or relevant derogatory information to the destination countries.  Following a November 11 deadline imposed by the Ministry of Interior for home countries to begin repatriation of their FTF citizens, at least some FTFs were repatriated over the explicit objections of their home countries.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Turkey is a member of the FATF.  Its FIU, the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Turkey is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  In December, FATF published a Mutual Evaluation Report that reviewed Turkey’s compliance with FATF standards and the effectiveness of Turkey’s AML/CFT system and found serious shortcomings.  To address these issues, MASAK has embarked on an action plan, which FATF will review at the end of the year.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Turkish National Police (TNP) undertakes social projects, activities with parents, and in-service training for officers and teachers.  Programs prepare medical, community, and religious officials to intervene to undermine terrorist messaging and to prevent recruitment.  The Ministry of Justice implements some rehabilitation and reintegration programs for convicts and former criminals.  The Ministry of Interior claimed in December that it has been in contact with the family members of more than 5,300 PKK members in Turkey and abroad and had used these connections to convince more than 600 PKK members to surrender.Turkey’s Religious Affairs Presidency (Diyanet) reports that it works to undermine terrorist messaging by promoting what it sees as an “inclusive” version of Islam.  All Hanafi Sunni imams in Turkey officially must be employees of Diyanet.The city of Antalya is a member of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Turkey is a member of the UN, NATO, the CT Committee for the CoE, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and it co-chairs, with Kuwait and the Netherlands, the Defeat-ISIS FTF Working Group.  Turkey hosted two meetings of the FTF Working Group in Ankara during the year.  Turkey regularly participates in GCTF meetings and initiatives.  Turkey also contributes to the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, a GCTF-inspired institution, and provides expert support to assist training for judges and prosecutors handling terrorism cases.  Turkey participates in OSCE expert meetings on the Prevention of Violent Extremism and Radicalization that Lead to Terrorism organized by the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the OSCE Secretariat.Turkey has bilateral security cooperation agreements with more than 70 countries.  The TNP contributes to CT capacity-building programs of partner countries and offers specialized international law enforcement training in a variety of sectors, including CT.The UK remains one of the strongest and most able U.S. partners in the global fight against terrorism.  CT cooperation with the UK is excellent.Throughout most of 2019, the terrorism threat level in the UK was at the second-highest rating (severe).  In early November 2019, the UK lowered the threat level to substantial, meaning the threat of an attack was reduced from “highly likely” to “likely.”  UK officials categorize Islamist terrorism as the greatest threat to national security, though officials identify a rising REMT threat, which they refer to as “extreme right-wing” terrorism.  In 2019, the UK government transferred responsibility for investigations and operations to counter REMT from local police to the national-level Security Service (MI5).  Since March 2017, police and security services have disrupted 15 Islamist and seven REMT plots.The threat level for Northern Ireland-related terrorism within Northern Ireland, set separately from England, Scotland, and Wales, remains severe. In November 2019, the four-member Independent Reporting Commission published the second of four annual reports assessing that paramilitarism “remains a stark reality of life” in Northern Ireland.  The report noted that the absence of an executive and functioning legislative assembly since the collapse of Northern Ireland’s devolved government in January 2017, as well as the “continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit,” have made efforts to end paramilitarism “immeasurably more difficult.”As a partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the UK continued to contribute to stabilization efforts in Iraq and northeastern Syria.  Countering ISIS remains one of the UK’s top CT priorities, and the UK is working with regional partners to develop border infrastructure, watchlists, and biometric capabilities to counter FTF movement.2019 Terrorist Attacks:  The UK suffered one terrorist attack in November 2019, in which a convicted terrorist who was out on parole killed two people with a knife at an event highlighting education programs for violent offenders.  In addition, in October, an assailant stabbed three people at a shopping mall in Manchester.  The UK government initially described the attack as terrorism, but later reclassified it as a mental health incident.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Following the June 2018 release of the UK’s CONTEST CT strategy, Parliament passed legislation granting the Home Office and law enforcement entities additional authorities in February 2019.The Counterterrorism and Border Security Act of 2019 went into effect on April 12 and included several provisions that enabled implementation of the new CONTEST strategy, including one allowing the Home Office to make it a criminal offense for UK citizens to travel to or remain in any geographic area designated by the government as “necessary to protect the public from terrorism.”  To date, the UK has not formally designated any areas.The Act also grants UK police, immigration, or customs officers the authority to stop, search, question, and detain individuals at a UK border area to determine whether they are “engaged in hostile activity.”  As of December 2019, UK law enforcement authorities were coordinating on implementation guidance for this new authority.In December 2019, the UK General Election resulted in a large majority for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party in Parliament.  PM Johnson has publicly called for longer sentences without the option for parole for convicted terrorist offenders and announced his intent to recruit 20,000 new police officers nationwide.According to Home Office figures, UK law enforcement agencies made 266 arrests for terrorism-related activity from January through June 2019.  As a result, 63 individuals were charged with terrorism-related offenses.  The Metropolitan police say there are about 800 active investigations involving about 3,000 individuals.  From July 2018 through June 2019, the UK convicted 50 people of terrorism-related offenses, and currently has more than 200 people in custody.  Of those convicted, 76 percent received sentences of less than 10 years.  Three were sentenced to life in prison.The UK uses advanced biometric screening at some points of entry and utilizes biometrics for vetting during the visa process; however, some ports of entry, such as ferry ports, have no biometric screening.  In 2019, the UK expanded the use of e-gate technology at major airports to include all Five Eyes travelers, as well as those from Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and travelers from the European Economic Area.  E-gate incorporates facial recognition technology to match travelers with data recorded in the e-chip of eligible passports.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The UK is a member of FATF and has observer or cooperating status in the following FATF-style regional bodies:  observer of APG, observer of ESAAMLG, observer of MENAFATF, and a cooperating and supporting nation of CFATF.  Its FIU, UK Financial Intelligence Unit, is also a member of the Egmont Group. The UK is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.The 2018 Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act provides the legal framework to implement sanctions after the UK left the EU.  In March 2019, under the Act, three statutory instruments were laid before Parliament that will ensure continuity of the UK’s counter terrorism sanctions obligations.As of June 2019, the UK had $91,237 of terrorist assets frozen under EU Regulation 881/2002, which implements the UN Security Council ISIL (Da’esh) and al-Qa’ida sanctions regime, and an additional $11,719 frozen under the Terrorist Asset Freezing Act 2010.  It also has $23,448 frozen under Council Regulation (EU) No 2580/2001.Countering Violent Extremism:  In October 2019, the Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE), a non-statutory expert committee of the Home Office, published a report calling for an overhaul of the UK’s approach to “extremist behavior,” with an emphasis on what it defines as “hateful extremism.”  The CCE operates independently and recommended that the Home Secretary chair a new task force charged with formulating a “victim-centered” strategy.In April 2019, the UK released the Online Harms White Paper, announcing its intent to establish in law a new duty of care for technology companies toward users for broadly scoped “harmful content” online, which will be overseen by an independent regulator.  Under this potential future law, companies and their senior executives will be held to account, including through criminal prosecution, for addressing a sweeping range of online content, including terrorist use of the internet, extremist content, disinformation, cyberbullying, and child sexual exploitation and abuse.Birmingham, Derry/Londonderry, Leicester, London, Luton, and Manchester are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  The UK continued to strongly support CT efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, as well as through the GCTF.  The UK is also a key member of the Five Country Ministerial, which promotes multilateral ministerial dialogue on border security and counter-terrorism issues.  The UK also cooperates with other OSCE participating states in the fight against terrorism.')"

    "complete_ME_text = ('THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAOverviewAlthough significant terrorist activities and safe havens continued to persist in the Middle East and North Africa throughout 2019, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and its local partners achieved important milestones, to include liberating the remaining territory held by ISIS in Syria and the successful raid against ISIS emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Given the collapse of its so-called “caliphate,” remnants of ISIS in Iraq and Syria reverted to clandestine tactics – a trend expected to continue.  Beyond Iraq and Syria, ISIS branches, networks, and supporters across the Middle East and North Africa remained active in 2019, including in Libya, the Arabian Peninsula, the Sinai Peninsula, Tunisia, and Yemen.  Al-Qa’ida (AQ) and its affiliates, as well as Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) and Iran-backed terrorist groups, also remained active throughout the region.ISIS continued its terrorist campaign in the Sinai through its branch ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP), and terrorist groups in Egypt carried out more attacks than in recent years.  Of note, ISIS-SP was the first ISIS affiliate to swear allegiance to the new ISIS self-proclaimed caliph following Baghdadi’s death.  In the Maghreb, counterterrorism efforts and operations by Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia thwarted the activities of ISIS and other terrorist groups.  Algerian armed forces and internal security forces published figures showing an increase in arrests of terrorists or terrorist suspects compared with 2018, and Tunisia increased its successful CT operations, including the killing of Jund al-Khilafah’s leader.  In Libya, nonstate actors conducted ground operations to neutralize the threat posed by ISIS and al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) fighters and facilitators.  The United States conducted precision airstrikes targeting ISIS cells in southern Libya, disrupting the group’s organizational presence in the South and eliminating key ISIS personnel.  Most terrorist attacks in Libya during the year were conducted by ISIS.Despite setbacks, AQ remained resilient and actively sought to reconstitute its capabilities and maintain safe havens amid fragile political and security climates, particularly in Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.  For example, AQ and AQ-affiliated groups continued to operate in Idlib province in northwest Syria and AQ-aligned Ansar al-Islam also posed a threat in Egypt.In Yemen, al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS’s Yemen branch continued to exploit the security vacuum created by the ongoing conflict between the Republic of Yemen Government and Iran-backed Houthi militants, while also contending with each other.  Additionally, the IRGC-QF and Hizballah continued to take advantage of the conflict to destabilize the region, including by providing weapons and training to Houthi militants who committed attacks against neighboring states.  AQAP used its tribal connections and public discontent with the Iran-backed Houthis to recruit new members, conduct attacks, and operate in areas of southern and central Yemen with relative impunity, although CT operations eliminated key leaders, pushed the group out of certain areas, and pressured the group’s networks.  Though significantly smaller than AQAP, ISIS’s Yemen branch engaged in operations against AQAP and continued to claim attacks against Yemeni security forces and civilians, as well as Iran-backed Houthis.Iran continued to use its IRGC-QF to advance its interests abroad, providing cover for intelligence operations, creating instability, and fomenting violence in the Middle East.  In April, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the IRGC, including the Qods Force, as an FTO for the IRGC’s continued support to and engagement in terrorist activity around the world.  This was the first time the United States ever designated part of another government as an FTO, reflecting that the Iranian regime is unique in using terrorism as a basic tool of its statecraft.Among other malign activities, in September, Iran targeted some of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s most important oil-processing facilities, and Iran also continued to acknowledge the active involvement of the IRGC-QF in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, the latter in support of the Assad regime.  Through the IRGC-QF, Iran continued its support to several U.S.-designated terrorist groups, providing funding, training, weapons, and equipment.  Among the groups receiving support from Iran are Hizballah, Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Kata’ib Hizballah (KH) in Iraq, and al-Ashtar Brigades in Bahrain.  Iran also provided weapons and support to Shia militant groups in Iraq, to the Houthis in Yemen, and to the Taliban in Afghanistan.  In December, KH launched a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base hosting U.S. and Coalition forces, killing one American civilian contractor and wounding several U.S. and Iraqi service members.  In an immediate response to that attack, the United States carried out precision strikes against five targets associated with KH in Iraq and Syria.  On December 31, Iran instigated an attack by demonstrators, including Iran-backed terrorists and militia members, on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which resulted in damage to embassy property.Countries in the Gulf region continued to take important steps to combat terrorism.  Following the third U.S.-Qatar Counterterrorism Dialogue in November, the two governments declared fulfillment of their July 2017 Memorandum of Understanding largely complete and committed to set shared counterterrorism priorities for 2020.  Saudi Arabia and the United States continued to co-lead the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), an initiative founded in 2017 to increase U.S.-Gulf multilateral collaboration to counter terrorist financing.  In 2019, TFTC members imposed sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the Middle East.  The ongoing rift between Qatar on one side and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt on the other continued to strain regional cooperation and unity of effort, particularly on countering Iranian threats.In the Levant, Jordan and Lebanon both remained committed partners to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  Several terrorist groups, most notably Hizballah, continued to operate in Lebanon throughout the year.  Hizballah remained Iran’s most powerful terrorist partner and the most capable terrorist organization in Lebanon, controlling areas across the country.  Iran’s annual financial backing to Hizballah – which in recent years has been estimated at $700 million – accounts for the overwhelming majority of the group’s annual budget.  Hizballah’s presence in Lebanon and Syria continued to pose a threat to Israel.  Israel published information in August about Hizballah’s efforts to produce precision-guided missiles (PGMs) within Lebanon.  While Hizballah said it possessed enough PGMs for a confrontation with Israel, it denied missiles were being developed in Lebanon.  Israel also uncovered and destroyed multiple tunnels dug by Hizballah under the border into Israel that could have been used for terrorist attacks between December 2018 and January 2019.  Although Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza and the West Bank continued to threaten Israel, Israeli and Palestinian Authority security forces continued their coordination in the West Bank in an effort to mitigate violence.The United States and Algeria built on their CT partnership through regular dialogue and exchanges of technical expertise.  Algeria continued its significant efforts to prevent terrorist activity within its borders and remains a difficult operating environment for terrorist groups.  Algerian armed forces and internal security forces published figures that showed continued pressure on terrorist groups.  In 2019, the Algerian government increased the number of arrests of terrorists or terrorist supporters compared with the previous year and undertook a comparable number of operations to destroy arms and terrorist hideouts.  Some analysts assessed that Algeria’s steady drumbeat of sweeping operations substantially diminished the capacities of terrorist groups to operate within Algeria.  AQIM, AQIM-allied groups, and ISIS’s Algeria branch – including elements of the local group known as Jund al-Khilafah in Algeria (or Soldiers of the Caliphate in Algeria) – remained in the country but were under considerable pressure by Algerian security authorities.  These groups aspired to impose their interpretations of Islamic law in the region and to attack Algerian security services, local government targets, and Western commercial interests.  Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and Tunisia – as well as human, weapons, and narcotics trafficking – contributed to the overall threat, particularly in border regions.Algeria’s domestic efforts to defeat ISIS through counter-messaging and their capacity-building programs with neighboring states indirectly contribute to the Global Defeat-ISIS Coalition mission.  Algeria is a member of the GCTF and co-chaired the GCTF’s West Africa Region Working Group.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Neither AQIM nor ISIS conducted any attacks in Algeria in 2019, although media reported that, on January 16, an unidentified terrorist group killed a lone shepherd in Tarek Ibn Ziad, a mountainous area about two-and-a-half hours southwest of Algiers.  Several clashes, however, took place between terrorists and security forces during sweeping operations in which AQIM and ISIS primarily used IEDs and small arms.  Algerian armed forces clashed with terrorists in 2019 in the following operations:On November 6, Algerian forces killed three members of a terrorist group in Tipaza, west of Algiers.  Five Algerian soldiers were reported killed in the skirmish.On November 18, Algerian forces killed two alleged ISIS members during an operation along the southern border with Mali.  ISIS media outlets characterized the same incident as an attack killing eight Algerian troops.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Algeria has made no significant changes to its CT legal framework since 2018.  The Algerian government maintained its strict “no concessions” policy with regard to individuals or groups holding its citizens hostage.Algerian military forces and multiple law enforcement, intelligence, and security services addressed counterterrorism, counter-intelligence, investigations, border security, and crisis response.  These included the various branches of the Joint Staff, the Algerian army, 140,000 members of the National Gendarmerie, and border guards under the Ministry of National Defense (MND); and about 210,000 national police, or General Directorate of National Security, under the Ministry of Interior.  Public information announcements from the MND provided timely reporting on incidents during which MND forces captured or eliminated terrorists and seized equipment, arms, ammunition caches, and drugs.Border security remained a top priority.  Media reported on continued cooperation between Algeria and Tunisia including a joint Algerian-Tunisian terrestrial and aerial force military operation against ISIS strongholds in the border area, resulting in the destruction of terrorist hideouts and homemade bombs.  The Government of Algeria closely monitored passenger manifests of inbound and outbound flights.  Algeria also has a national API and PNR strategy and is setting up an API/PNR commission.  As of this year, Algeria has a Passenger Information Unit operating under the General Directorate of Customs.  Government officials made active use of INTERPOL databases at ports of entry.Algerian law enforcement agencies participated in training and exchanges offered by the U.S. government and by third countries.  Algerian participants attended numerous workshops conducted under the GCTF, the UN, and other multilateral organizations.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Algeria is a member of the MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Algeria pursues a whole-of-government approach to CVE, including rehabilitation and reintegration programs for repentant terrorists.  The regulation of mosques to ensure they are “de-politicized” and “de-ideologized” is a key aspect of the Algerian approach.  Algeria acknowledges the crucial role of women and families in CVE efforts, and of its mourchidates, female Muslim clerics who work with young girls, mothers, and prisoners.  The Algerian government monitors mosques for possible security-related offenses and prohibits the use of mosques as public meeting places outside of regular prayer hours.  Government officials publicly affirm Algeria’s Sunni Maliki tradition of Islam, which they believe provides a “moderate” religious vision for the country.  The government periodically imposes restrictions on other variants of Islam for failure to abide by administrative procedures required of all religious institutions.International and Regional Cooperation:  Algeria continued to support CT efforts through regional and multilateral organizations.  As co-chair of the GCTF’s West Africa Region Capacity-Building Working Group, Algeria participated in joint working group meetings with other GCTF elements.  Algeria has taken a leadership role in AFRIPOL, the Algiers-based AU mechanism for police cooperation, whose mandate is to enhance African police cooperation and prevent transnational crime and terrorism.  In 2019, Algeria hosted the AFRIPOL general assembly and the first meeting of heads of national AFRIPOL liaison offices.  Algeria also hosted the AU’s annual CVE focal point representatives meeting at the Algiers-based African Center for Study and Research on Terrorism.Algeria continued diplomatic engagement to promote regional peace and security.  Algeria remains chair of the implementation committee for the peace accord in Mali and continued to support the UN political process in Libya.  Algeria also participated in various Sahel-Saharan fora to discuss development and security policies and the evolution of regional terrorism.  Regional tensions between Morocco and Algeria remained an impediment to bilateral and regional CT cooperation in 2019.There were no successful terrorist attacks in Bahrain in 2019, but domestic security forces conducted numerous operations to preempt and disrupt attack planning.  The Government of Bahrain (GOB) is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and supported U.S. government counterterrorism efforts.  Political relations between the predominantly Sunni-led government and Shia-majority opposition remained tense, exacerbated by the July execution of two Bahraini Shia convicted on terrorism charges.  According to press and NGO reports, confessions are usually obtained through torture, and mistreatment and abuse of Shia persons by security forces continues.  GOB initiated numerous programs intended to improve community and security force relations.  Bahrain experienced periodic low-level violence in predominantly Bahraini Shia villages, usually to mark notable dates of importance, such as the anniversary of the 2011 political unrest.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist attacks reported in Bahrain in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In May, the GOB ratified amendments to Bahrain’s 2006 Anti-Terror Law that allows for penalties of up to five years in prison for encouraging or possessing materials that support “terrorist activities.”Throughout the year, Bahrain continued to conduct security operations targeting suspected militants.  Individuals apprehended during security raids were tried in Bahraini courts, and some were convicted of involvement in terrorism-related activities.  In April, a Bahraini court sentenced to prison 139 Bahrainis, of whom 69 received life sentences (25 years), on terrorism charges; the court also ordered the revocation of their citizenships.  The GOB accused the individuals of forming an organization it referred to as “Bahraini Hizballah” with the intention of carrying out attacks in Bahrain.  Also in April, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa restored the citizenship of 551 prisoners, some of whom were convicted of terrorism.  On October 31, the judiciary issued life sentences to five nationals for “forming a terrorist cell” affiliated with al-Ashtar Brigades.In July, Bahrain executed two individuals who were found guilty in January 2018 of involvement in terrorist operations that led to the death of a Ministry of Interior police officer in 2017.  The executions prompted demonstrations particularly in Bahraini Shia villages, and one 22-year-old protester died from what the GOB said was natural causes.  Subsequent protests in response to the youth’s death were non-violent.Bahraini law enforcement agencies participated in training and technical assistance offered by the U.S. government.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Bahrain is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Financial Intelligence Directorate, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Bahrain is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG and the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC).On August 28, the GOB convicted nine suspects of receiving and transferring funds to support terrorist activities; authorities handed down maximum jail terms of six years and imposed fines of up to $37,695.On December 2, in collaboration with other TFTC member states, Bahrain imposed one round of sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the region.As of December 2, Bahrain added “Hizballah of Bahrain, ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the 14 February Youth Coalition, al-Ashtar Brigades, People’s Resistance Brigades, al-Mukhtar Brigades, Bahrain Freedom Movement” to its terror list.Countering Violent Extremism:  The GOB continued its efforts to adopt a national strategy in line with the UN Secretary-General’s “Preventing Violent Extremism Plan of Action.”  Additionally, numerous officials from the GOB and local NGOs developed programming targeting youth and other vulnerable populations.The GOB attempted outreach through initiatives such as the community police, which bridges the divide between the Bahraini Shia community and police force.  In March, the Interior Minister launched the “National Plan to Promote the Spirit of Belonging,” a program intended to foster a shared Bahraini identity.  An executive committee was formed to oversee ministry activities under the initiative, also known as Bahrainuna (We are Bahrain).There is no overall strategic messaging campaign to counter terrorist narratives, although GOB leaders often speak publicly about tolerance and reducing sectarian rhetoric.  GOB restrictions on freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and association may also increase the likelihood of radicalization.A large number of Bahraini Shia youths serving prison sentences related to crimes committed during Bahrain’s 2011 political unrest are expected to be released within the next several years. Prison conditions may increase the likelihood of radicalization.International and Regional Cooperation:  As of December 2019, members of the Bahrain Defense Force were deployed in Yemen as part of the Saudi-led coalition against the Iran-backed Houthi militants and al-Qai’da in the Arabian Peninsula.  Bahrain is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab League.  Bahrain continued to offer its support for countering Iran’s malign activities in the region. Nearly all terrorist attacks in Egypt took place in the Sinai Peninsula and largely targeted security forces, but terrorist attacks targeting civilians, tourists, and security personnel in mainland Egypt remained a concern.  Though early 2019 witnessed a series of IED incidents in greater Cairo, those incidents became more infrequent as the year progressed.  ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP) carried out the majority of the total attacks in 2019, though it claimed no attacks in mainland Egypt and no attacks against Western interests.  ISIS-SP responded to ISIS’s call to increase attacks to avenge the terrorist group’s territorial defeat in Syria in March.  ISIS-SP was the first affiliate to swear allegiance to the new self-proclaimed caliph in November.  There were at least 151 IED-related attacks in Egypt in 2019, of which ISIS-SP conducted at least 137 in northern and central Sinai, along with near-weekly complex assaults on government-fortified positions, demonstrating the terrorist group’s freedom to maneuver during daytime hours and geographic expansion of attacks westward, toward the Suez Canal Zone, and southward.  In addition, Harakat Sawa’d Misr (HASM) and al-Qa’ida allied groups such as Ansar al-Islam are believed to be behind the spate of anti-western attacks in mainland Egypt in 2019, and they also posed a continued threat.While terrorist attacks primarily targeted Egyptian security personnel, civilians and foreigners were also targeted.  Of note, terrorist groups carried out increased kidnappings and executions of individuals suspected of collaborating with the Egyptian government and military, particularly in April and June.  Coptic Christians and other religious minorities continue to be targets for terrorist attacks.As noted in the U.S. Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and International Religious Freedom Report, NGOs continued to claim that authorities used counterterrorism and state-of-emergency laws and courts unjustly to prosecute journalists, activists, lawyers, political party members, university professors, and critics for exercising freedom of expression.Egypt is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Overall terrorist attack methods throughout Egypt included small arms attacks, IEDs, VBIEDs, kidnappings, executions, complex assaults, ambushes, and targeted assassinations.  Notable terrorist incidents in 2019 included:On January 23, HASM claimed responsibility for a VBIED attack targeting security forces in Giza, which killed or wounded 10 soldiers.On February 16, ISIS-SP attacked a government checkpoint near Al-Arish in North Sinai, killing 15 security personnel.On February 20, security forces detected and safely diffused an IED in Cairo planted by unidentified militants.On March 7, suspected terrorists opened fire on a security checkpoint on the Ring Road in Giza, resulting in one soldier wounded and three militants killed.On March 26, ISIS-SP claimed responsibility for an attack against aid workers in North Sinai that killed 12 civilians.On May 19, for the second year in a row, unidentified terrorists detonated an IED under a tour bus carrying foreigners near the Great Pyramids at Giza.On June 25, ISIS attacked a police assembly center and at least three checkpoints near Al-Arish in North Sinai, killing 10 people and wounding eight others.On July 16, ISIS-SP beheaded four individuals, whom the group claimed were informants for the Egyptian Armed Forces, near Bir al-Abd in North Sinai.On August 4, a VBIED detonated in front of the National Cancer Institute in Cairo.  The Egyptian government blamed HASM, though the group denied responsibility.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In March, the Egyptian Parliament’s legislative committee approved new amendments to the 2015 Anti-Terrorism Law, increasing the punishment to 10 years in prison for those who promote “extremist” ideology as defined by Egyptian law.  The punishment was increased to a minimum of 15 years if the promotion of “extremist” ideology was made at places of worship, public places, among members of the Armed Forces or the police, or in places allocated for these forces.  Parliament is expected to pass these amendments, and President Sisi is then expected to ratify them in 2020.In October, the Egyptian Parliament formed a new counterterrorism committee to revise national legislation and enable a more effective strategy against those who commit terrorist acts as defined by Egyptian law.  This committee will propose amendments to existing legislation that gives law enforcement agencies additional powers to fight terrorism and accelerate trials of suspects charged with terrorist attacks.  The committee will also make recommendations for religious and educational establishments, to include upgrading school curricula and removing content that might indirectly contribute to the “radicalization” of Egyptians.Egypt’s most significant physical border security concerns remained Libya, Sudan, and Gaza.  At border crossings and airports, Egyptian authorities continued to check for the presence of security features in travel documents.  They also conducted checks of some individuals and shared derogatory information across the Egyptian Border Guard.  Egypt maintains a terrorist watchlist for Egyptian immigration officials at the ports of entry, with detailed information maintained by the security services.  The United States assisted Egypt’s CT efforts by providing training, equipment, and other assistance to its law enforcement security services, as well as to the Egyptian Ministry of Defense.In July, British Airways and Lufthansa temporarily suspended flights to Egypt, citing unspecified security concerns, but resumed flights after one week and one day, respectively.  In October, the United Kingdom lifted restrictions on flights to Sharm el-Sheikh for the first time since flights were banned in November 2015 following the downing of a Russian Metrojet airliner in an attack claimed by ISIS-SP. Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Egypt is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Combating Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group and the National Council of Payments.  Egypt is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government continued its ongoing CVE efforts in 2019.  In January, the Ministry of Islamic Endowments (Awqaf) inaugurated an academy to train imams and preachers and brought together 130 ministers of endowments and muftis from around the world for a conference to counter “extremist narratives” and promote pluralism.  Al-Azhar continued to publish statements promoting tolerance and in January introduced several new academic textbooks focusing on the relationship between Muslims and Christians and promoting equal rights between the two religions.  In February, Pope Francis and Grand Imam Ahmed El-Tayyeb signed a historic document pledging fraternity between the Vatican and Al-Azhar to work together to fight “extremism.”  Al-Azhar additionally cooperated with the Arab League to continue organizing conferences focused on countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment.The Ministry of Awqaf additionally focused on bridging the divide between Muslims and Christians, bringing together representatives from both faiths to debate issues of mutual concern in an effort to address sectarian issues, particularly in Upper Egypt.Dar al-Iftaa, an official body associated with Al-Azhar that issues religious edicts, focused its efforts on rejecting “extremist” ideology.  In an effort to counter ISIS, which in the past has demolished several shrines, Dar al-Iftaa published a fatwa saying that praying in a mosque with a shrine annexed to it was commendable in Islam, despite other fatwas contrary to this position.The Cairo Center for Conflict Resolution and Peacekeeping in Africa (CCCPA) continued training through its Preventing Radicalization and Extremism Leading to Terrorism (PRELT) program, which aims to prevent the proliferation of “extremist ideology.”  CCCPA trained 21 Arab women leaders in refuting “extremist interpretations” of religion and developing alternative religious narratives, and it hosted an advanced PRELT training for Sahel religious leaders.The World Organization for Al-Azhar Graduates held a July workshop for Libyan imams and preachers with Azhari senior scholars on combating “extremism” and promoting moderate Islam.  In October, a similar event was held on promoting tolerance.Despite measures taken by the Egyptian government – such as establishing parameters to identify individuals vulnerable to recruitment and offering training and religious guidance to inmates – concerns persisted that Egyptian prisons continue to be a fertile environment for terrorist recruitment and radicalization.International and Regional Cooperation:  Egypt continued to support CT efforts through regional and multilateral organizations, including through the GCTF.  Egypt currently co-chairs the GCTF East Africa Working Group with the EU.  As Chair of the Peace and Security Council of the AU, Egypt regularly prioritized CT issues including during their ASWAN Forum.Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) remained in nominal control of territory liberated from ISIS.  ISIS continued to present a serious threat to Iraqi stability, undertaking targeted assassinations of police and local political leaders and using IEDs and shooting attacks directed at both government and government-associated civilian targets, in support of a violent campaign to reestablish a caliphate.  ISIS sought to reestablish support among populations in Ninewa, Kirkuk, Diyala, Salah ad Din, and Anbar provinces, especially in the areas of disputed control between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the federal government, where the division of responsibility for local security is unclear.  Although ISIS maintained the capability to conduct deadly terrorist attacks in Iraq, these attacks resulted in fewer casualties in 2019 than in previous years.  Attacks by Iran-backed Shia militia groups on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. and Defeat-ISIS Coalition forces increased in 2019, killing and wounding American and Iraqi servicemembers.  The Iran-backed, U.S.-designated KH continued to operate in Iraq and in some cases sought to enter local politics by backing provincial candidates.  The Government of Iraq issued Executive Order 237 which required all Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), including those backed by Iran, to operate as an indivisible part of the armed forces and be subject to the same regulations; however, many of these groups continued to defy central government command and control and engaged in violent and destabilizing activities in Iraq and neighboring Syria, including attacks on and abductions of civilian protesters.  The Kurdistan Workers Party (commonly known as the PKK), a terrorist group headquartered in the mountains of northern Iraq, continued to conduct attacks in Turkey.Iraq is a pivotal member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and a participant in all Coalition Working Groups (Foreign Terrorist Fighters, Counter-ISIS Finance Group, Stabilization, and Communications).2019 Terrorist Incidents:  According to the Federal Intelligence and Investigation Agency within Iraq’s Ministry of Interior, acts of terrorism, violence, and armed conflict with ISIS killed more than 534 civilians and injured more than 1,121 in 2019 as of December 1.  This was a decrease from 2018, when roughly 900 civilians died and 1,600 were injured.  ISIS continued to carry out suicide and hit-and-run attacks throughout the country with 844 attacks during the year.  The most significant of these was a bus bombing in September that killed 12 Iraqis near the major pilgrimage site of Karbala.  In addition, Iran-backed Shia militia groups are believed to be responsible for more than a dozen rocket or indirect fire attacks targeting U.S. or Coalition targets in Iraq in 2019, including the December 27 attack in which KH launched more than 30 rockets at an Iraqi base hosting U.S. forces in Kirkuk, killing one American contractor and wounding several American and Iraqi service members.  Other prominent terrorist attacks included:On January 11, a VBIED detonated in a market in al-Qa’im, on the Syrian border in western Anbar, killing two civilians and injuring 25 others.ISIS targeted truffle hunters mostly in Anbar province, kidnapping more than 44.  On June 1, nine bodies were found west of the town of Rutba, some 300 kilometers west of Anbar’s provincial capital Ramadi.On November 8, a car bomb exploded near a restaurant in Mosul, Ninewa governorate, killing 13 people and wounding 23 others.On November 16, an IED exploded in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square where anti-government protesters gathered.  There were no reported casualties.On November 29, ISIS attacked Kurdish security force (Kulajo Asayish) headquarters in Kifri district, Diyala governorate, killing three Asayish members, including the unit’s director.On December 4, an ISIS tactical element comprising 10 to 15 members conducted an attack against the Ministry of Peshmerga’s 3rd Regional Guard Brigade, killing three and wounding two others.On December 31, Iran-backed Shia militia groups, including KH, participated in an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which resulted in significant damage to embassy property.  There were no embassy casualties and security personnel used less-than-lethal countermeasures to repulse intruders.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Iraq made no significant changes to its counterterrorism legal and law enforcement framework in 2019.Border security remained a critical capability gap, as the ISF has limited capability to fully secure Iraq’s borders with Syria and Iran.  While border security along the periphery of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) is robust and administered by various security units under the Kurdish Minister of Interior, the border with Syria south of the IKR remained porous and vulnerable to ISIS and other terrorist networks, as well as to smuggling and other criminal enterprises.  Iran-backed PMF units continued to maintain a presence at Iraq’s major border crossings.  The Iraqi government re-opened the Iraq-Syria border crossing in al-Qa’im under Border Police control, though various PMF units positioned themselves to the north and south of the main checkpoint.Iraq and the United States partnered to close a gap in border security through broader deployment of and upgrades to the U.S.-provided PISCES.  The Ministry of Interior shared biometric information upon request on known and suspected terrorists and shared exemplars of its identity documents with the United States, INTERPOL, and other international partners, though there remained no agreement or arrangement in place that would support the implementation of an intended U.S. program to facilitate biometric information-sharing on both terrorist and criminal suspects.  In the Disputed Internal Boundaries, ISIS continues to exploit the security vacuum between Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga Forces.  Recent attacks in the northern Diyala and activities along Qarachogh Mountain indicate ISIS presence.  Counterterrorism efforts in the Disputed Internal Boundaries areas have been hampered by the lack of coordination between Peshmerga and ISF, mainly due to the relationship between the KRG and the Government of Iraq.  Additionally, Iraq has taken preliminary steps to partner with UNITAD in the collection of digital, documentary, testimonial, and forensic evidence to support the prosecution of ISIS members for their atrocity crimes committed in Iraq.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Iraq is a member of MENAFATF.  Iraq is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  In 2019, the IKR began setting up its own AML/CFT Committee that will coordinate across relevant KRG ministries and work with the IKR’s Terrorism Finance Unit.The Government of Iraq – including the Central Bank of Iraq, law enforcement, security forces, and the judiciary – continued to dismantle ISIS’s financial networks and safeguard Iraq’s financial institutions from exploitation by ISIS.  Efforts include:Iraq cooperates closely with the U.S. government on multiple U.S. designations under U.S. CT authorities.Iraqi and Kurdish agencies coordinating actions with the U.S. Departments of Defense and the Treasury against Afaq Dubai to disrupt and curtail ISIS’s logistical infrastructure and its ability to generate, store, and use funds for recruiting and paying its fighters and for its operations.Iraq shared a list of banned exchange houses and money transfer companies with regional regulators and tasking judicial action against more than a dozen individuals and companies suspected of illicit financial activity.  These actions ranged from business closures to arrests of suspects.Countering Violent Extremism:  Iraq remained active in its strategic messaging to discredit ISIS, including through its membership in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Communications Working Group, and engaged with U.S. military and civilian counterparts to develop a wide range of capabilities to build national cohesion and combat terrorist ideology.  The Government of Iraq and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS also implemented stabilization, reconciliation, and accountability programs to strengthen locals’ ability to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.Many Iraqi ISIS fighters remained in Iraqi custody, along with ISIS-affiliated foreign women and children.  Iraq acknowledged that the return and reintegration of family members of suspected ISIS supporters, as well as the provision of fair and equal justice, are important to prevent future terrorist radicalization and violence.  However, more than 1.4 million Iraqis remain displaced within Iraq, and more than 30,000 – mainly women and children – reside in the al-Hawl IDP camp in Syria.  Iraq publicly stated it has no intention of housing Iraqi ISIS fighters with the general prison populations in Iraqi prisons.  The lack of separate, secure detention facilities within Iraq delayed Iraqi efforts to repatriate additional Iraqi fighters detained abroad.International and Regional Cooperation:  Iraq continued to work with multilateral and regional organizations – including the UN, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, NATO, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, INTERPOL, and the Arab League – to support CT efforts.Israel was a committed counterterrorism partner in 2019, closely coordinating with the United States on a range of counterterrorism initiatives.  Israel and the United States held numerous interagency counterterrorism dialogues to discuss the broad range of threats in the Middle East and to determine areas of collaboration to address these challenges.  This included the annual meeting of the U.S.-Israel Joint Counterterrorism Group, which was launched in the early 1990s and is our longest-standing strategic counterterrorism dialogue.Israel faced threats from the north from Hizballah and along the northeastern frontier from Hizballah and other Iran-backed groups, including about 150,000 rockets aimed at Israel.  Israeli officials expressed concern that Iran was supplying Hizballah with advanced weapons systems and technologies, as well as assisting the group in creating infrastructure that would permit it to indigenously produce rockets, missiles, and drones to threaten Israel from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, or Yemen.To the south, Israel faced threats from terrorist organizations including Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and ISIS-Sinai.  Rocket attacks originating from Gaza resulted in four deaths and dozens of injuries in 2019.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Israel experienced numerous terrorist attacks in 2019 involving weapons ranging from rockets and mortars to small arms and knives.  The following is a partial list of terrorist incidents that occurred in 2019:On February 7, an assailant violently assaulted and stabbed to death 19-year-old Ori Ansbacher in the EinYael forest near Jerusalem.  Police arrested Arafat Irfiya, a 29-year-old Palestinian man from Hebron and reported he admitted the attack was “nationalistically motivated.”Hamas and other terrorist groups including PIJ launched more than 1,000 rockets and mortar shells from Gaza toward Israel during the year, some of which landed in civilian areas.  For details, see “West Bank and Gaza” section below.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Israel has a robust legal framework to combat terrorism and promote international legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of terrorists.  In December, the defense minister signed the first executive order placing economic restrictions on assets of an individual connected to terrorism:  Mohammad Jamil, a Hamas activist living in the United Kingdom.Israeli security forces took numerous significant law enforcement actions against suspected terrorists and terrorist groups.  The following examples represent some of the law enforcement actions taken in 2019:On October 28, Border Police officers arrested two ISIS members who planned a terrorist attack either in Jerusalem or against an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) army base in the Jordan Valley with the intention to kill as many civilians and military personnel as possible.In June, Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) arrested an Israeli Bedouin supporter of Hamas, who planned to bomb a hotel in southern Ashdod.On August 6, Israeli security forces arrested three members of a Hamas bomb team, thwarting a major plot targeting Jerusalem.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Israel remains a full member of the FATF.  Israel’s FIU, the Israeli Money Laundering and Terror Finance Prohibition Authority, is a member of the Egmont Group.In accordance with the Israeli Deduction Law, the Ministry of Defense announced in February 2019 that it would withhold $138 million ($12 million a month) from monthly tax revenue Israel collects and transfers to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the amount Israel determined the PA paid in 2018 to Palestinians connected to terrorism, including Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prison and released Palestinian terrorists.  The PA responded to Israel’s withholding by refusing to accept any of its remaining tax revenues from Israel, representing about 65 percent of the PA’s budget.  As the PA’s fiscal situation worsened, the PA eventually agreed in October 2019 to accept its remaining tax revenues.In December 2019, Israel announced that it would withhold an additional $43 million from PA revenues for payments the PA provided during 2018 to families of Palestinians who were wounded or died while committing terrorist acts or in connection with terrorism.  Israel also seized funds the PA paid to eight Israeli Arabs convicted of terrorism and their families.  The PA argues these payments are social payments for families who have lost their primary breadwinner.  The United States and Israel argue the payments incentivize and reward terrorism, with higher monthly payments for lengthier prison sentences tied to more severe crimes.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Ministry of Public Security supported and funded Israel’s flagship City Without Violence initiative.  One hundred fifty-one municipalities implemented education and social welfare projects to counter violence, crime, and terrorism.  The program emphasized partnerships with the Israel National Police, with the goal of reducing violence and increasing citizen-police communication.The president of Israel’s initiative, Israeli Hope, in cooperation with government ministries, established a sustainable partnership across different segments of Israeli society, focusing on projects ranging from education to employment to sports.  The sports initiative, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Culture and Sports, implemented programs aimed at countering racism and reducing violence in collaboration with professional soccer clubs and players.International and Regional Cooperation:  According to media reports, Israeli intelligence helped Denmark foil a series of terror attacks, resulting in 22 arrests in December.  Other media reports stated that Israeli intelligence officials helped foil more than 50 terrorist attacks planned worldwide by Iran and its proxies, as well as by ISIS, during the 2017-2019 period.The West Bank and GazaOverview:  The Palestinian Authority continued its counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts in the West Bank, where Hamas, PIJ, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) remained active.  PA officials continued to make inconsistent statements about a commitment to non-violence.  The PA security forces constrained the ability of terrorist organizations and individuals to conduct attacks, in part by arrests targeting those planning attacks against Israelis.  Per Oslo-era agreements, the PA exercised varying degrees of authority over the West Bank owing to the presence of IDF in certain areas, as well as frequent Israeli entry into PA-controlled areas for counterterrorism operations.  The IDF and Shin Bet also arrested individuals and members of terrorist organizations operating in the West Bank.The United States continued to coordinate with PA security forces in counterterrorism efforts.  U.S. advisory support assisted the PA as it continued to develop professional security forces capable of some, but not all, counterterrorism functions.The number of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israelis in the West Bank in 2019 was in line with rates in recent years and lower than rates during the heightened period of violence from October 2015 to April 2016.  Methods employed included stabbings, shootings, bombings, and vehicular attacks.Some Israelis committed retaliatory “price tag” attacks involving property crimes and other violent acts against Palestinians in the West Bank in 2019.  For example, in November 2019, “price tag” attacks were reported in multiple Palestinian villages in which vehicles were vandalized and olive tree groves were destroyed.Hamas maintained control of Gaza in 2019.  Several militant groups, including Hamas and PIJ, launched rocket attacks against Israel from Gaza, including significant attacks against Israel in May.  PIJ led other large attacks against Israel in November and members of PIJ committed suicide attacks against Hamas civil police.  During weekly protests at the Israel-Gaza security fence with Israel, Palestinians threw Molotov cocktails and IEDs, and they launched incendiary balloons and devices towards Israel, damaging farms and nature preserves.  According to the head of Israel’s Eshkol regional council, the total damage in 2019 was estimated at $3.46 million.  Hamas and PIJ terror tunneling activities continued.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  The following are representative examples of some of the terrorist incidents:Hamas and other terrorist groups including PIJ launched more than 1,000 rockets and mortar shells from Gaza toward Israel during the year, some of which landed in civilian areas.  The IDF confirmed that the Iron Dome, Israel’s air defense system, intercepted most of these projectiles.In March, a rocket from Gaza hit a house in Kfar Saba, injuring seven people including grandparents and three children.Also in March, at the Ariel junction in the West Bank, a Palestinian stabbed an IDF soldier, grabbed his weapon, and shot him.  As he escaped, the assailant shot and killed a civilian and wounded another soldier before briefly escaping and ultimately being killed in a shootout with the IDF.In May, during a barrage of 690 rockets and mortars from Gaza, six Israelis were killed.  In July, a Palestinian man crashed his car into a group of five IDF soldiers and wounded them near the Hizma check point.In August, Palestinians detonated a homemade bomb in a public area near Ramallah, killing an Israeli teenager and wounding her father and brother.  According to Shin Bet, the suspects were members of the PFLP.Also in August, two suicide bombers detonated themselves near police checkpoints in Gaza City, killing three police officers and wounding three other Palestinians.Also in August, two Palestinian men were arrested for stabbing to death an 18-year-old Yeshiva student near Gush Etzion Junction.During November 12-13, 562 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into Israel, forcing schools to close and civilians to take shelter in affected areas.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The PA lacked comprehensive legislation specifically tailored to counterterrorism, although existing Palestinian laws criminalize actions that constitute terrorist acts.  Presidential decrees prohibit incitement to violence, illegal associations, providing financial support to terrorist groups, and acts that run counter to Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) agreements with other states (an indirect reference to the Oslo Accords with Israel).  The Palestinian legislature, the Palestinian Legislative Council, was dissolved in December 2018 and is therefore unable to pass new laws.  Governance is managed by presidential decree.  NGOs claimed that at times the PA made arbitrary arrests based on political acts and affiliation, including criticism of the PA online.The Preventive Security Organization is the key PA institution that works to prevent West Bank terrorist attacks and investigates security-related criminal conduct.  In practice, the General Intelligence Organization also plays a critical role in this effort, as does, to a lesser extent, the Military Intelligence Organization.Per previous agreements, Israel retained control of border security across the West Bank and general security throughout Area C, which encompasses a majority of the West Bank.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The PA is a member of MENAFATF, a Financial Action Task Force-style regional body, and will next be reviewed in 2020.  The Palestinian Financial Follow-Up Unit (FFU) is the PA’s FIU.  Banks file suspicious transaction reports (STRs) and currency transaction reports electronically through the FFU computer system.  In 2019, banks, law enforcement agencies, and other entities filed approximately 160 STRs (year to date, December 11, 2019) compared with 124 in 2018.In 2019, the Palestinian Monetary Authority launched a new banking system, titled Know Your Customer, designed to help keep track of the sources and recipients of financial transactions to facilitate transparency, ensure customs duty collection, and comply with anti-money laundering laws.Countering Violent Extremism:  Official PA media, TV, and social media accounts affiliated with the ruling political movement Fatah have featured content praising or condoning acts of terrorism, and Palestinian leaders did not consistently publicly condemn individual terrorist attacks.  President Mahmoud Abbas has stated in the past a commitment to non-violence, a two-state solution, and previous PLO commitments, but he has also made inconsistent statements that appear to contradict and undermine his prior commitments.  Abbas said on Palestinian media on March 24, “We want to achieve our right and our state peacefully…We will not choose a path other than negotiations to achieve our right.”  But according to translation by MEMRI, Abbas said on August 10, “So we say to them:  ‘Every stone you [used] to build on our land and every house you have built on our land is bound to be destroyed, Allah willing…Jerusalem is ours whether they like it or not… We shall enter Jerusalem – millions of fighters!  We shall enter it!  All of us, the entire Palestinian people, the entire Arab nation, the Islamic nation, and the Christian nation… They shall all enter Jerusalem…’”International and Regional Cooperation:  PA justice, security leaders, and PA security force personnel continued to participate in regional conferences and meetings to combat terrorism. Jordan remained a committed partner on CT in 2019.  As a regional leader in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Jordan played an important role in Coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group.  Jordan continued to face a persistent threat of terrorist activity both domestically and along its borders, owing in part to its proximity to regional conflicts in Iraq and Syria and the state’s official rejection of Salafi-Jihadi interpretations of Islam.  Terrorist entities continue to express interest in attacking both “hard” and “soft” targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, tourist locations, and Jordanian security services.  The most notable terrorist incident in 2019 was the November 6 attack targeting foreign tourists in Jerash.  Jordanian security forces thwarted several plots and apprehended numerous terrorists; however, coordination among Jordan’s security services for terrorism response capabilities and prevention remains a challenge, but it continues to improve.Border security remains an overarching priority for the Jordanian government, given fears that violence from the conflict in neighboring Syria will spill over into its territory.  There were many Jordanian nationals among FTFs in Iraq and Syria, and the threat of domestic radicalization, especially online, remains.  Returning FTFs are an ongoing concern for Jordan’s security services.  As a member of the GCTF, Jordan continued to be a committed partner on FTF issues in 2019 as co-chair with the United States of the GCTF FTF Working Group.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  On November 6, a 22-year old Palestinian from a nearby refugee camp stabbed eight people, including four foreign tourists, in Jerash, one of Jordan’s most popular tourism sites.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Jordan made no significant changes to its counterterrorism legal framework in 2019.  The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) is the primary government agency responsible for counterterrorism.  It operates with support from various elements within the Jordan Armed Forces, the Public Security Directorate, and the Gendarmerie.  The Jordanian government continued to implement measures and conduct joint exercises to improve interagency coordination among security agencies during responses to terrorism-related events.  Enhanced overt security measures are in place across Jordan, most visibly at hotels and shopping malls.Jordanian security services disrupted a number of terrorist plots in various stages of operational planning.  While successful interdictions showcase the government’s efforts, they come in response to attempts to conduct terrorist operations in Jordan from a variety of terrorist groups or individuals with terrorist aspirations, including those inspired by ISIS and al-Qa’ida.  On November 12, the Jordanian newspaper Al-Rai reported that the GID thwarted terrorist operations of two suspects who planned to target employees of the U.S. and Israeli embassies, as well as U.S. soldiers at a military base in the Jafr region.  The GID reportedly arrested the two suspects in July, and their trial in the State Security Court (SSC) began in early November.  The SSC sentenced one of the suspects to eight years in prison for threatening to attack the Israeli Embassy in Amman.  The SSC also convicted several detainees on terrorism charges.  Sentences ranged from three years to life in prison with hard labor.In 2019, Jordan did not extradite Ahlam Aref Ahmad Al-Tamimi, a Jordanian national in her mid-30s, who has been charged in the United States with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against U.S. nationals outside the United States resulting in death.  The charge is related to her participation in the August 9, 2001, suicide bomb attack at a pizzeria in Jerusalem that killed 15 people, including two U.S. nationals.  Four other U.S. nationals were among the approximately 122 others injured in the attack.  Following publication of the 2018 Country Reports on Terrorism, Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi confirmed that U.S. authorities asked Jordan to extradite Tamimi, and he expressed the view that Jordan’s constitution does not allow the extradition of a Jordanian citizen to a third country.  The United States regards the extradition treaty with Jordan as valid and in force.Jordan continued to reinforce its border defenses and surveillance capabilities in response to terrorist and criminal threats emanating from its 230-mile border with Syria and 112-mile border with Iraq.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Jordan is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Jordan is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  MENAFATF completed its mutual evaluation of Jordan in 2019; while not published before the end of 2019, the report contained several recommendations to enhance its AML/CFT regime.Countering Violent Extremism:  Jordan is implementing a national strategy on preventing violent extremism coordinated by an office within the Prime Ministry.  Priority areas for engagement include countering terrorist ideology, building social cohesion among civil society, and assisting law enforcement.  Officials regularly engage experts on topics such as the role of women and girls in terrorism prevention, and the monitoring and evaluation of local conditions conducive to terrorism.  Civil society organizations have undertaken work across the country to address causes of terrorism and offer positive alternatives to youth through activities that build critical thinking skills, encourage civic participation, increase awareness of online safety, and address the needs of returning terrorist fighters and their families.  Irbid, Karak, and Zarqa are members of the SCN and worked to develop capacity in local communities to prevent violence and build community cohesion.Jordan, in partnership with the United States, held the first Aqaba Process Tech Meeting to counter terrorism online in February 2019 in Napa, California, which included governments, technology companies, international organizations, civil society, and academics.  Jordan held a follow-up Aqaba Process meeting in Amman in June that likewise focused on countering terrorist use of the internet.  In September, Jordan co-sponsored with New Zealand and France at the United Nations the high-level “Leaders Dialogue:  Strategic Responses to Terrorist and Violent Extremist Narratives.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Jordan is a major non-NATO ally and founding member of the GCTF.  It is a member of the United Nations, the Arab League, the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and the Proliferation Security Initiative.  Jordan also participates in the UN’s Group of Friends of Preventing Violent Extremism.During 2019, the Government of Kuwait participated in or conducted a significant number of training programs to build CT capacity and to counter terrorism financing.  Kuwait is a regional leader in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, part of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition Small Group, and co-leads (with Turkey and the Netherlands) the Coalition’s Foreign Terrorist Fighters Working Group.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Kuwait in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Throughout 2019, Kuwaiti government officials participated in several CT capacity-building workshops.  Several of these were supported by the U.S. Department of State and implemented through the U.S. Department of Justice Overseas Prosecutorial Development Assistance and Training program.  In February, the Kuwaiti Public Prosecutor’s office participated in a workshop on Best Practices in Cyber Investigations and Prosecutions.  In March, the Ministry of Interior and the Kuwait State Security trained on FTF-related investigations.  In April, Kuwait hosted the GCC Regional Cyber Investigations Conference with attendees from 26 entities across the Gulf and several domestic Kuwaiti entities, many focused on CFT.  In October, the FIU and the National Committee for Combatting Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism participated in a seminar on money laundering and countering the funding of terrorism.  Kuwait also concentrated on law enforcement and judicial capacity building across a broad spectrum of government agencies.In July, the Kuwait state news agency reported that the Ministry of Interior had deported eight Egyptian citizens who were wanted in Egypt for terrorism-related convictions.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Kuwait is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Kuwaiti Financial Intelligence Unit , is a member of the Egmont Group.  Kuwait is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG and the TFTC.In collaboration with other TFTC member states, in 2019 Kuwait imposed one round of sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the region.Countering Violent Extremism:  Kuwait’s Ministry of Education continued to implement a program to fight what it viewed as extremist ideologies at public schools through teacher-training and student-counseling programs.  As part of the government’s National Plan to Reinforce Moderation, the Ministry of Information runs a television channel with programming aimed at audiences believed to be at higher risk of radicalization.  The Kuwait Moderation Center, which operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Religious Endowments, sponsored a variety of programs designed to promote religious tolerance, including establishing working groups to reduce sectarian conflict, holding symposia on protecting the rights of non-Muslims in a Muslim society, and a program in the school system to promote diversity and tolerance and combat sectarianism.  The Moderation Center continued a program to enable social salon (diwaniya) hosts to invite religious scholars to join in discussions with attendees and counter the potential presence of radicalizing influences.  The center also sponsored radio programs to promote tolerance among youth.  In December, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sponsored a workshop titled “The Concept of Extremism and its Reflection on Society.”  More effective measures are needed to prevent charitable donations being routed to regional terrorist groups or support for educational and religious advocacy efforts that encourage discrimination and violence.  Kuwait is looking to better monitor charitable donations that might be used to support terrorist elements.International and Regional Cooperation:  During 2019, Kuwait served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the second year of its two-year term.  Kuwait remained an active member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Small Group, participating in a number of ministerial-level meetings throughout the year.  Kuwait has also long been an active member of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  As a member of the GCC, Kuwait has played a leading role in the effort to mediate the dispute between Qatar and other GCC members.Lebanon remains a committed partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.Terrorist groups operating in Lebanon included Hizballah, ISIS, Hamas, and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades.  Of these, the Lebanon-based and Iran-backed terrorist group Hizballah remained the most capable.  In August 2019, Israel publicly released information about Hizballah’s efforts to produce precision-guided missiles (PGMs) within Lebanon.  Hizballah announced that the group possessed enough PGMs for a confrontation with Israel but denied that it was developing PGM factories in Lebanon.  Between December 2018 and January 2019, Israel uncovered and destroyed multiple tunnels dug by Hizballah under the border into Israel that could have been used for terrorist attacks.Despite the Lebanese government’s official policy of disassociation from regional conflicts, Hizballah continued its military role in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, in collaboration with the Iranian regime.  Separately, Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian refugee camps remained largely outside the control of Lebanese security forces and posed a security threat because of the potential for militant recruitment and terrorist infiltration.  In addition, several individuals on the FBI’s most wanted list or listed by the State or Treasury Departments as Specially Designated Global Terrorists reportedly remained in Lebanon.2019 Terrorist Incidents:On June 3, Abdel Rahman Mabsout, a lone Lebanese gunman associated with ISIS, attacked a police patrol in Tripoli and killed two Internal Security Forces (ISF) officers and two Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) soldiers before killing himself after being cornered by security forces.  The attacker was previously arrested in 2016 for fighting for ISIS in Syria and imprisoned in Lebanon but was released in late 2017.On September 1, Hizballah launched three guided antitank missiles across the border into Israel at an IDF vehicle.  The missiles did not cause any casualties.Hizballah continued to plan attacks around the world, as detailed in other sections of this report.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Lebanon does not have a comprehensive counterterrorism law, but several articles of Lebanon’s criminal code are effectively used to prosecute acts of terrorism.  No new laws related to terrorism were passed in 2019.  The LAF, ISF, the Directorate of General Security (DGS), and the General Directorate of State Security were the primary government agencies responsible for counterterrorism.  Although cooperation among the services was inconsistent, they took steps to improve information sharing and were receptive to additional capacity building and reforms.  Structural limitations in the justice system remained a barrier for conducting trials for terrorism cases in a timely manner.The LAF held primary responsibility for securing Lebanon’s land and maritime borders, while DGS and Customs were responsible for official points of entry.  The LAF improved its ability to control Lebanon’s land border with Syria through the Land Border Security Project funded by the United States, the UK, and Canada.  This project resulted in greater control of the border and the arrest of ISIS members entering Lebanon from Syria.  In February, the LAF arrested a Palestinian affiliated with the al-Nusrah Front for his role in fighting taking place inside the Ein el-Hilweh Refugee Camp.Lebanon collected biographic data for travelers at the Beirut International Airport, as well as API and PNR data for commercial flights.  The United States worked with Lebanon to develop a central repository to process and share biometric data among Lebanese services.  In 2019, Lebanese security services collaborated with the United States on numerous instances to foil terrorist plots and investigate and apprehend individuals involved in terrorism.The presence of Hizballah in the Lebanese government was an impediment to effective host government action against terrorist incidents.  For instance, the government took no action to hold Hizballah accountable for its rocket attack on Israel in September or the cross-border tunnels, and prevented the UN Interim Force in Lebanon from fully investigating these incidents by failing to provide access to the areas where these incidents occurred.  In international fora, Lebanon argued that acts taken against what it characterized as “foreign occupation” are not terrorism, in an attempt to justify Hizballah’s violence against Israel.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Lebanon is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Special Investigation Commission (SIC), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Lebanon is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.In 2019, the SIC took actions to comply with new U.S. sanctions against a number of Hizballah members and financers, including the sanctioning of Jammal Trust Bank for providing financial services to Hizballah.  Lebanon also designated several individuals and entities on its national terrorism-financing list established pursuant to UNSCR 1373/2001 and proposed several designations to the UNSCR 1267/2253 Sanctions Committee.  Lebanese authorities were still compiling specific statistics on such actions at year’s end.During the first nine months of the year, the SIC received 12 terrorism and terrorism-financing cases from local sources, out of which six cases were referred to the general prosecutor.  The SIC reported that numerous terrorism and terrorism-financing prosecutions were carried out by judicial authorities in Lebanon, several of which led to convictions.On August 29, Lebanon acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.  However, it submitted a reservation concerning the definition of terrorism to endorse the definition from the Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism of 1984, which excludes any acts taken against what is characterized as “foreign occupation.”Countering Violent Extremism:  The National Preventing Violent Extremism Coordination Unit organized nine workshops on PVE in 2019.  Local and international donor efforts included participation in the SCN, as well as prevention programs in prisons.International and Regional Cooperation:  Lebanon supported CT efforts in regional organizations and participated in counterterrorism finance programs, such as MENAFATF.  Lebanon offered training to regional peers in international standards to combat terrorist financing.The ongoing conflict involving the Government of National Accord (GNA) and Libyan National Army (LNA)-aligned forces, as well as other nonstate actors, prevented Libyan authorities from dedicating sufficient resources to the fight against terrorist groups.  However, both GNA- and LNA-aligned forces conducted CT operations during the year, arresting or killing dozens of ISIS or AQIM fighters.  U.S. strikes on ISIS-Libya targets further degraded this group.  The GNA continued to work with the United States to counter the spread of terrorist groups such as ISIS-Libya and AQIM, albeit to a more limited degree following the departure of U.S. forces from Libya in April.  The GNA’s effectiveness was constrained both by the lack of control it exerted over national forces and by its diminished geographic reach.Since the 2016 expulsion of ISIS from Sirte, the group has lacked a concentrated, physical presence in Libya, instead spreading into smaller groups with a presence in both urban environments and the sparsely populated desert districts of Jufra, Sebha, and Murzuq.  In southern Libya, where terrorist groups operated most freely, forces aligned with the LNA conducted operations against AQIM and ISIS.  All acknowledged terrorist attacks by ISIS in 2019 were conducted against LNA forces or against civilian targets in areas under LNA control.  The LNA undertook CT efforts in areas under its control.In coordination with the GNA authorities in Tripoli, the United States conducted four precision airstrikes on ISIS in southern Libya in September 2019, killing 43 ISIS fighters and displacing remaining elements.  The GNA has also cooperated with the United States on the investigation of suspected terrorists.  Libya is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents: On April 9, ISIS militants killed two people in the town of al-Fuqaha in Jufra province (central Libya).  One of the victims was the head of the municipal council.  The group also kidnapped an LNA security official and burned several houses in the town.  Former ISIS head Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi later praised the attack in a video.On May 4, ISIS fighters carried out an assault against LNA forces at the Jabril Baba camp near the southern Libyan city of Sebha, killing at least nine LNA soldiers from the 160th Brigade, one of whom was beheaded.  ISIS later claimed to have released inmates detained in the training camp’s detention facility.On May 9, ISIS conducted an attack on the town of Ghadduwa (45 miles south of Sebha), killing three people, including former Libyan diplomat Ali al-Kaboush.  ISIS also kidnapped one individual and issued a statement claiming responsibility for burning down 14 houses and local LNA military facilities.On May 18, ISIS fighters conducted a small-arms attack at a checkpoint on the road from Zilla to Waddan near a facility operated by a subsidiary of the Libyan National Oil Corporation, killing three LNA soldiers and briefly kidnapping four others.  One of the ISIS fighters reportedly detonated a person-borne improvised explosive device to prevent capture.On July 11, three explosive devices were detonated at the Huwari Cemetery in Benghazi during the funeral of Khalifa Mismari, a former Libyan Special Forces commander.  Several high-ranking LNA officers were present at the scene of the attack.  No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed four and wounded 33.On August 10, unknown attackers detonated a car bomb in front of a shopping mall near the Commerce and Investment Bank in the Hawari neighborhood of Benghazi targeting a UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) convoy.  The attackers killed three UNSMIL guards and wounded scores of bystanders, including children.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Libya did not pass or implement any CT legislation in 2019.  Libya lacks a comprehensive CT law, although the Libyan penal code criminalizes offenses that may threaten national security, including terrorism, the promotion of terrorist acts, and the handling of money in support of such acts.  Libya has ratified the Africa Union’s Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, which requires states to criminalize terrorist acts under their national laws.  The GNA has continued to support and seek international cooperation to combat ISIS.A number of state and nonstate organizations, both outside and under official GNA authority, claimed CT responsibilities.  GNA-aligned groups with the greatest CT capacity included the Misratan Joint Security Operations Room (MJSOR) and the Tripoli-based Special Deterrence Force (aka “Rada Force”), a Salafist militia nominally integrated into the GNA Ministry of Interior.  MJSOR, Rada Force, and the GNA MOI conducted more than 20 arrest operations against terrorists who were current or former members of ISIS, AQIM, and other AQIM-affiliated groups in 2019, detaining more than 31 terrorist suspects.  The LNA Western, Eastern, and Southern CT Operations Rooms conducted more than 25 operations during which it arrested at least 57 and killed at least 44 individuals connected with these same terrorist groups.  Because of the limited geographic reach of the internationally recognized GNA, the GNA’s ability to deter or reduce terrorist activities was limited to areas under its control.  Libyan law enforcement personnel lacked clear mandates and the capacity to detect, deter, respond to, or investigate terrorist incidents due to continued political and security force fragmentation.The Libyan government, through its National Team for Border Security and Management, continued work in 2019 to develop a comprehensive border management strategy.  Although approval of a national strategy will be an important step, Libya continues to struggle to secure the country’s thousands of miles of land, air, and maritime borders.  The U.S. Department of State provided training and other technical assistance to Libyan airport officials, border guards, customs agents, and police and intelligence forces in securing airports against the threat of terrorism, which included preventive security measures consisting of access control, passenger and cabin baggage screening, hold baggage screening, and air and mail cargo handling.Despite the arrests of dozens of new terrorist suspects and the referral of some suspects to the public prosecutor, there were no reported terrorism-related prosecutions in 2019.  In many parts of Libya, armed groups, rather than state institutions, provide security and law enforcement functions, including detention of terrorist elements.  National police and security forces are fragmented, are inadequately trained and equipped, and lack clear reporting chains and coordination mechanisms.  Libya’s military forces are similarly weak and fragmented.  Nonstate armed groups often overshadow formal security structures.The following are two examples of operations and arrests by state and nonstate forces in 2019:On November 29, the GNA Ministry of Interior arrested Emad Faraj Mansour al-Shuqabi on terrorism charges related to his collaboration with known members of ISIS.  Al-Shuqabi was arrested by the Tajoura Branch of the Central Support Forces, and he was referred to the GNA Attorney General for prosecution.On December 13, the LNA-aligned Central Investigations Directorate in Benghazi arrested two men under the suspicion of smuggling funds for terrorist financing purposes in support of ISIS in cooperation with an Egyptian national.  Following the arrests, firearms and ammunition were recovered at the suspects’ homes.  Both men confessed to the allegations, identifying two other suspects in the process, and their files were transferred to the public prosecutor in Benghazi.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Libya is a member of MENAFATF.  Libya is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  International assistance continued in 2019, although the outbreak of conflict for Tripoli in April forced many donor nations to curtail assistance efforts or conduct assistance outside Libya.  Libya is a member of the UN, the AU, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab League, and it has participated in regional workshops administered by the UN.The United States and Morocco have robust and long-standing CT cooperation.  The Government of Morocco continued its comprehensive CT strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation, and counter-radicalization policies.  In 2019, Morocco’s CT efforts largely mitigated its risk of terrorism, doubling the number of arrests compared with 2018.  The country continued to face sporadic threats, largely from small, independent terrorist cells, the majority of which claimed to be inspired by or affiliated with ISIS.  In March 2019, Morocco repatriated eight FTFs from Syria.  Morocco is an active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  Morocco is also a member of the GCTF and is currently the co-chair of the GCTF with Canada.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Morocco in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Morocco continued to investigate, prosecute, and sentence defendants under its CT legislation, enacted in 2003 and expanded in 2015.In 2019, Morocco’s Council of Ministers approved a draft law to manage trade in dual-use goods, which would give Moroccan law enforcement authority to control the import, export, and transit of dual-use goods and related services that could be used for WMD proliferation related purposes, to include the development of a WMD program.In 2019, under the direction of the Ministry of Interior, Moroccan law enforcement aggressively targeted and reported to have arrested more than 125 individuals, effectively dismantling more than 25 terrorist cells in the early stages of planning attacks against a range of targets, including public buildings, public figures, and tourist sites.  Moroccan law enforcement leveraged intelligence collection, police work, and collaboration with international partners to conduct CT operations.   Three men who murdered two Scandinavian hikers in the Atlas Mountains in 2018 were sentenced to death in July 2019 (though Morocco has had a moratorium on executions since 1993), while a fourth man received a life sentence.The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) remains the primary law enforcement agency responsible for CT prosecutions.  The BCIJ reports to the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance and operates under the supervision of the public prosecutor of the Court of Appeals.  The following offers a snapshot of arrests in 2019:In January, Moroccan authorities dismantled a 13-person cell for inciting terrorist crimes and undermining the state’s security in the cities of, Casablanca, Mohammedia, and Sale, seizing electronic devices, bladed weapons, and a written pledge of allegiance to ISIS.In May, Moroccan authorities dismantled a nine-member cell pledging allegiance to ISIS that planned to perpetrate terrorist attacks in Tangier, seizing electronic devices, paramilitary uniforms, and harpoon guns.In October, Moroccan authorities dismantled a seven-person cell operating in Casablanca, Chefchaouen, and Ouazzane that was preparing to target sensitive infrastructure and strategic sites, seizing bladed weapons, diving equipment, and ISIS flags.Border security remained a top priority for Moroccan authorities.  The General Directorate for National Security has primary responsibility for conducting border inspections at ports of entry such as Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport.  Law enforcement officials and private airline carriers worked regularly with the United States to detect and deter individuals attempting to transit illegally and to address watchlisted travelers.  Moroccan airport authorities have excellent capabilities in detecting fraudulent documents.  In addition, police, customs officers, and the Royal Gendarmerie operated mobile and fixed checkpoints along the roads in border areas and at the entrances to major municipalities.  Moroccan naval and coast guard units monitored and patrolled Morocco’s extensive coastal waters, including the Strait of Gibraltar, to interdict illicit traffickers.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Morocco is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Unité de Traitement du Renseignement Financier, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Morocco is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG.  In August, MENAFATF published a Mutual Evaluation Report that reviewed Morocco’s compliance with FATF standards and the effectiveness of Morocco’s AML/CFT system; the report contained several recommendations to enhance its AML/CFT regimes.Countering Violent Extremism:  Morocco has a comprehensive CVE strategy that prioritizes countering radicalization and oversight of the religious sphere.  To counter what it views as religious extremism, Morocco promotes an interpretation of the Maliki-Ashari school of Sunni Islam, which it considers tolerant.  The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs has developed an educational curriculum for Morocco’s nearly 50,000 imams, as well as for female clerics (mourchidates).  In 2019, Morocco’s imam training center in Rabat trained more than 2,700 religious leaders, mostly from West Africa, which included more than 400 women graduates.  The Royal Mohammedan League of Ulema (Rabita Mohammedia) counters radicalization by producing scholarly research, reviewing educational curricula, and conducting youth outreach on religious and social topics.In prisons, the U.S. Department of State has supported the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration’s (DGAPR’s) efforts to modernize prison management, develop prisoner classification tools, and construct more secure facilities.  The DGAPR has conducted four offerings of its deradicalization program, Moussalaha (Reconciliation) and plans to open the program to female prisoners in 2020.International and Regional Cooperation:  Morocco is currently a co-chair of the GCTF with Canada.  Morocco hosted one GCTF event in June 2019, an Africa-focused regional workshop on the “Initiative on Improving Capabilities for Detecting and Interdicting Terrorist Travel through Enhanced Terrorist Screening and Information Sharing,” an initiative that Morocco co-chaired with the United States.  Morocco also participated in UN-led workshops on detecting and preventing terrorist travel.  Morocco is a major non-NATO ally.  Morocco hosted the annual African Lion exercise and participated in multilateral regional training exercises.  Morocco is an active member of the TSCTP.  Morocco also has strong cooperation with European partners – especially Belgium, France, and Spain – to thwart potential terrorist threats in Europe.  Regional tensions between Morocco and Algeria remained an impediment to CT cooperation in 2019.Oman is an important regional CT partner that actively worked in 2019 to prevent terrorists from conducting attacks or using the country as a safe haven.  The Omani government remains concerned about the conflict in Yemen and the potential for al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS-Yemen to threaten Oman’s land and maritime borders.  Omani officials regularly engaged with U.S. officials on the need to counter terrorism, but rarely broadcast their CT efforts publicly.  The Government of Oman sought training and equipment from the U.S. government, commercial entities, and other countries to support its efforts to control Omani land, air, and maritime borders.  Oman also used U.S. security assistance to improve its crisis management capacity, as well as its CT tactics and procedures.  Oman is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the Saudi-led Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC), and the Riyadh-based TFTC.  The Government of Oman also issued several statements condemning terrorist attacks around the world in 2019.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Oman in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Oman did not promulgate new laws related to penalties for terrorist activity in 2019 but continued to implement the penal code released by Royal Decree 7/2018 in January 2018.  This code expands on previously established penalties and specifically stipulates imprisonment for a term of three to 15 years for any Omani citizen who joins or offers either material or “ideological” support to a foreign terrorist or “extremist” organization.  Other provisions in the penal code are consistent with previous policies outlining penalties, including the death penalty and life imprisonment, for various terrorist acts, including establishment or leadership of a terrorist group, attempts to join a terrorist group, attempts to recruit for a terrorist group, development of an explosive or weapon, or takeover of any mode of transportation for purposes of terrorism.CT investigations, crisis responses, and border security capabilities were limited by local capacity and an operating environment made challenging by Oman’s extensive coastline and long, remote borders with Saudi Arabia and Yemen.  Nevertheless, Oman had adequate communication and coordination among its many agencies that have CT jurisdiction.  The Sultan’s Special Forces and the Royal Oman Police Special Task Force are Oman’s primary CT response forces.  The Royal Office Liaison and Coordination Service and the Internal Security Service also play key roles in securing Oman from terrorist threats.  Omani authorities have developed specific plans to prevent or respond to terrorist attacks against soft targets.The major impediments to more effective law enforcement and border security are limited resources, insufficient Omani interagency coordination, and the need for continued training to develop advanced law enforcement skills.  The rugged, mountainous terrain along Oman’s border with Yemen is an additional challenge.  To address these significant hurdles, Omani authorities continued construction of a fence along the border with Yemen to prevent illegal entry into Oman, and the Omani government continued to seek opportunities for additional U.S. border security training.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Oman is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Financial Information Processing Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group. Oman is also a member of the TFTC.In collaboration with other TFTC member states, Oman in 2019 imposed one round of sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the region.  In November, the Central Bank of Oman, the National Committee to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorism Finance, and the National Committee for Combating Terrorism met to strategize about enhancing protections against money laundering in Oman.In December, Omani officials participated in a DOJ-led workshop focused on disrupting terrorist and criminal funding mechanisms through effective online undercover investigations.Countering Violent Extremism:  The full nature and scope of Oman’s CVE initiatives remained opaque in 2019, but it is believed Oman continued to counter terrorist recruitment through tightly controlled, private initiatives.In 2019, Oman’s Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs continued to encourage religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue through a program titled “Tolerance, Understanding, Coexistence – Oman’s Message of Islam.”  After facilitating several events in Europe in 2018, the ministry promoted the initiative in 2019 through exhibitions in the United States, Indonesia, and Nepal.International and Regional Cooperation:  In April, the IMCTC announced that 13 member countries, including Oman, sent delegates to the IMCTC headquarters in Riyadh.  Oman regularly votes in favor of CT measures in the UN General Assembly, the Arab League, and the Organization for Islamic Cooperation.The United States and Qatar continued to increase CT cooperation in 2019, building on progress made after the U.S. Secretary of State and Qatari Foreign Minister signed a CT MOU in July 2017.  At the U.S.-Qatar Counterterrorism Dialogue in November 2019, the two governments declared their fulfillment of the MOU largely complete and committed to set shared priorities for 2020.  Qatar is an active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, is active in all Defeat-ISIS Coalition working groups, and facilitated U.S. military operations in the region.  Qatar hosts roughly 10,000 U.S. service members on two military installations critical to Coalition efforts.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist attacks reported in Qatar in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, the Qatari government drafted new AML/CFT legislation, which was finalized and passed into law on September 11, 2019.  As of late 2019, Qatari authorities were in the process of finalizing AML/CFT bylaws, as well as a new CT law that will include language on targeted financial sanctions.Qatar maintains an interagency National Anti-Terrorism Committee (NATC) composed of representatives from more than 10 government agencies.  The NATC is tasked with formulating Qatar’s CT policy, ensuring interagency coordination, fulfilling Qatar’s obligations to counter terrorism under international conventions, and participating in multilateral conferences on terrorism.  U.S. officials met regularly with the chairman of the NATC to discuss implementation of the CT MOU and overall CT cooperation.  The Qatar State Security Bureau (SSB) maintained an aggressive posture toward monitoring internal terrorism-related activities.  The Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Internal Security Force (ISF) remained well positioned to respond to incidents with rapid reaction forces that routinely engage in structured CT training and exercises, including with U.S. agencies.  Qatar’s Office of Public Prosecution was active in developing its new units devoted to prosecuting terrorism and CFT cases.As a result of the CT MOU signed in 2017, the United States and Qatar continued to partner on terrorist screening and aviation security.  In 2019, MOI authorities continued to cooperate with officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection and Transportation Security Agency to enhance screening capabilities of the estimated 30 million travelers who pass through Hamad International Airport each year.U.S. technical assistance to Qatari law enforcement and judicial agencies increased during 2019.  The U.S. Departments of Justice, State, and the Treasury, as well as the FBI, led or participated in several capacity-building initiatives involving the MOI, the ISF, the SSB, the Public Prosecution, the Central Bank, and other Qatari agencies.  A DOJ resident legal advisor has been stationed in Qatar since April 2018, providing technical assistance to Qatar’s CT efforts and building prosecutorial capacity.  In November 2018, Qatar began using its own funds to pay for a three-year U.S. Department of State Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training program, including training pertinent to Qatar’s preparations to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022; the primary recipients are MOI and ISF officers.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Qatar is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Qatar Financial Information Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Qatar is also a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s CIFG and the TFTC.In collaboration with other TFTC member states, Qatar in 2019 imposed one round of sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the region.The Qatari government passed a new AML/CFT law in 2019 and sought feedback from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. government during the drafting process.Qatar continued to maintain restrictions, imposed in 2017, on the overseas activities of Qatari charities, requiring all such activity to be conducted through one of two approved charities in an effort to better monitor charitable giving for terrorist financing abuse.Countering Violent Extremism:  The core of Qatar’s CVE strategy remained intensive investment in education and increasing economic opportunities for youth around the globe, largely through Qatar Foundation and related organizations, such as Silatech, Education Above All, and Reach Out to Asia.  Qatar cohosted a high-level event promoting the power of sport to prevent and counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment on the margins of UN General Assembly in September 2019.  Qatar has made significant strides in addressing state-sourced internal and external support for educational and religious content espousing intolerance, discrimination, sectarianism, and violence, although examples are still found in textbooks and disseminated through satellite television and other media.Qatar was also a major funder of GCERF and sits on its Governing Board of Directors.  The Qatar Fund for Development supported GCERF’s efforts to build awareness among community leaders about the impact of terrorist radicalization and recruitment, share information on how to respond to terrorism, promote peace through community engagement activities, and provide educational initiatives.Qatar’s Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) also supported English language programming in Ministry of Education schools as a means of countering terrorist influence and messaging.  MEHE facilitated extracurricular English reading and writing workshops in primary schools.  In November 2019, the Qatar National Library co-hosted an “open mic” event for high schoolers to promote critical thinking, tolerance, and peaceful expression.International and Regional Cooperation:  Qatar is an active CT participant in the UN, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab League.  Qatar is also a member of the GCTF and a major contributor to GCERF.  The country was active in GCC activities, but the Gulf dispute that broke out in June 2017 froze most GCC-wide engagements.  Qatar continues to participate, however, in TFTC activities in Riyadh.In 2019, Saudi Arabian government officials continued to work closely with their U.S. counterparts to deploy a comprehensive and well-resourced CT strategy that included vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation, and measures to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  Saudi Arabia maintained a high cooperation tempo with U.S. and international partners in a range of CT fields, including terrorist information sharing, monitoring of FTFs, border security, countering unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and CVE.  The Saudi Arabian government worked to disrupt, and supported U.S. and international sanctions against, terrorist finance networks, focusing heavily on entities supporting Iran’s IRGC-QF, Lebanese Hizballah, and other Iranian proxy groups active in the Gulf.Attacks by Iran on September 14 targeted some of the Kingdom’s most important oil-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais.  Saudi authorities moved quickly to bolster the facilities’ security posture, restore oil processing and export capacity, and repair damaged infrastructure.  To help deter Iranian aggressive behavior and enhance Saudi capacity, Saudi Arabia agreed to host U.S. service members.As in previous years, Saudi Arabia was a full partner and active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and provided significant operational and logistical support for Coalition activities in Syria and Iraq.  Saudi operations in Yemen included CT missions against AQAP and ISIS.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Saudi Arabia suffered from numerous terrorist incidents in 2019.  Terrorist incidents included both external attacks by Iranian and Houthi actors and small-scale attacks, largely perpetrated by lone offender actors including ISIS sympathizers.  Militants instigated violence using IEDs, gunfire, and UAS.  Attacks in 2019 included:On April 7, two suspected terrorists were killed and another two arrested by Saudi security forces when they attacked a vehicle checkpoint in Abu Hadriya on the Dammam-Jubail highway.  Two non-Saudi civilians were injured in the exchange of gunfire between the suspects and Saudi security forces.  Two Saudi security officials also sustained injuries.On April 21, Saudi security officials killed four suspected terrorists in a failed terrorist attack on a Ministry of Interior building in the town of Al Zulfi, Riyadh Province.  The militants detonated an explosive suicide belt, and three Saudi security officials were injured in the exchange of fire.  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.On May 14, unmanned aircraft systems targeted two pumping stations on the East-West pipeline carrying crude oil from Dhahran to Yanbu.  Yemen-based Iran-backed Houthi militants claimed responsibility.On June 12, Saudi-led coalition senior officials reported a cross-border cruise missiles attack at Abha International Airport, injuring 26 civilians.  Yemen-based Iran-backed Houthi militants claimed responsibility for this attack.On August 17, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants struck a natural gas liquids plant at Shaybah oilfield in the Kingdom’s Empty Quarter with drones.  The drone strike damaged the facility and caused a fire.  No deaths or casualties were reported.On September 14, Iranian attacks hit the Abqaiq and Khurais oil processing facilities in the Eastern province, initially taking 5.7 million barrels per day of crude oil production offline.  Although Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants claimed responsibility for the attack, investigations led by Saudi Arabia and the United States concluded the Iranian government was behind the attack.  Saudi Aramco resumed pre-attack production levels less than two weeks later, ahead of schedule.In addition, on December 6, 2019, a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force opened fire in a classroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, killing three and wounding eight.  The gunman, 2nd Lt Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was a student who was receiving training at the base.  The FBI later noted that Alshamrani had coordinated with AQAP before the terrorist attack, for which the latter claimed credit.  The Government of Saudi Arabia continues to work closely with the United States on the investigation.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, the Saudi Arabian government used its 2017 counterterrorism law to prosecute cases.  The State Security Presidency (SSP) and the Saudi General Investigations Directorate, also known as the Mabahith, took the lead in terrorism-related investigations.  Well positioned to respond to incidents, the SSP aggressively investigated terrorist suspects and dismantled suspected ISIS terrorist-related cells within its borders.  According to press reports, the Specialized Criminal Court, tasked with judicial oversight of criminal hearings, heard several terrorism-related cases.  The court sentenced 38 convicts to death for terrorism-related crimes, with one Yemeni executed on April 9 and 37 Saudis executed on April 23.  Some international human rights and press groups continued to assert that the Kingdom has misused counterterrorism laws to prosecute religious and political dissidents, women’s rights activists, and prominent Saudi clerics.  Saudi Arabia remained a country of particular concern, a designation it has held since 2004 for systematic violations under the International Religious Freedom Act, including for repression of religious freedom and religious minorities.  The Anti-Defamation League and other human rights organizations reported that Saudi textbooks, media, and preaching continued to feature content that condones violence against Jews, Christians, Shia, LGBT persons, and others.  See the 2019 International Religious Freedom report.Saudi Arabia remained committed to securing its borders and denying safe haven to terrorists.  With an extensive border security network, the Ministry of Interior closely monitored passenger manifests for inbound and outbound flights and used travel document security technology, API/PNR, and biometric screening capabilities at ports of entry.  The General Directorate of Border Guards expanded search operations to detect and disrupt terrorist activity and effectively patrolled land and maritime borders.  Officials from the Saudi Border Guards, charged with monitoring the coast within the Kingdom’s territorial waters, called for international agreements to combat the growing threat of maritime terrorism targeting oil tankers and coastal installations in the Gulf.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Saudi Arabia is a member of FATF and MENAFATF.  Saudi Arabia became the first Arab nation to achieve full membership in the FATF in June.  Its FIU, known as the Saudi Arabia Financial Investigation Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Saudi Arabia is also a member of the Defeat ISIS CIFG and the TFTC.In collaboration with other TFTC member states, Saudi Arabia in 2019 imposed one round of sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the region.Countering Violent Extremism:  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform package calls on all ministries to undertake measures to confront and weaken the violent ideology that underpins terrorist propaganda.  The Muslim World League Secretary General, Dr. Mohammed al-Issa, pressed a message of interfaith dialogue, religious tolerance, and peaceful coexistence with global religious authorities, including Muslim imams outside the Arab world.  He also conducted outreach with a variety of Jewish and Christian leaders, including prominent U.S. rabbis and Christian evangelicals.Saudi Arabia has recently initiated lines of CVE effort to foster reform and regulate religious activities.  The government reported that it continued to work to constrain the discriminatory content of its education, satellite, and religious advocacy output both overseas and domestically.  Nevertheless, its decades-long support for organizations that propagated intolerant interpretations of Islam overseas remained a concern, as did uneven implementation of educational content reform.  Ministry of Islamic Affairs officials continued to conduct outreach to imams across the country, encouraging them to refute “radical extremist” ideology in their sermons and replacing imams who included inflammatory rhetoric in their mosque sermons.  Through routine monitoring of terrorist websites and social media accounts, authorities attempted to dispel what the Saudi government views as misinterpretations of Islamic theology.  In 2019, there also was an increased emphasis on family outreach mechanisms to reduce the risk of travel to conflict zones to avoid terrorist radicalization or participation in terror-related activities.  Terrorist de-radicalization programs in Saudi prisons and at the Mohammed bin Naif Care and Counseling Center remained a main feature in the reintegration and monitoring of former terrorists.International and Regional Cooperation:  Saudi Arabia’s regional diplomatic efforts to fight terrorism saw a strong uptick in 2019, as the country partnered with several nations on a bilateral and regional basis to improve information sharing related to CT activities.  Through the UN Counter-Terrorism Center, the GCTF, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Saudi Arabian government worked to strengthen capacity and monitor new terrorist trends through policy coordination, capacity building, and operational collaboration with international partners.  Saudi Arabia signed multiple CT MOUs with international partners and hosted three diplomatic conferences – the Makkah Summit, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Summit, and the Arab Summit – all of which included counterterrorism discussions.  Saudi Arabia is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.Although the risk of terrorist activity in Tunisia remained high in 2019, the Tunisian government’s improved counterterrorism capacity and coordination, as well as its prioritization of border security, contributed to a reduction in the number and severity of terrorist attacks.  The dual suicide attack on June 27 by ISIS-inspired individuals was the most ambitious of 2019, but the Tunisian government’s response was well orchestrated and quickly restored public calm and resulted in arrests.  The increased number of successful CT operations throughout 2019, including the killing of Jund Al Khilafah leader Houssem Thelithi Mokni, reflected greater interagency coordination, improved preemptive planning, and sustained momentum in dismantling terrorist cells.The government continued to prioritize counterterrorism and border security in light of escalated Libyan instability and political uncertainty in Algeria.  U.S security assistance increased in 2019, and Tunisia leveraged cooperation with the United States and the international community to continue to professionalize its security apparatus.  Tunisia grew its overall CT capacity, outlined ways to implement a national PVE/CVE strategy, and expanded its freezing of terrorist assets.  As fundamental CT goals are being met, Tunisia will need time and continued support to focus on streamlining its CT efforts, to expand strategic planning, and to enhance interagency coordination to sustain gains and ensure mid- to long-term force sustainability.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist organizations remained active; however, their ability to carry out effective attacks was degraded by improved coordination and capacity of Tunisian security forces.  Lone wolf attacks continued to pose a challenge to security forces.  The following list summarizes the most significant terrorist incidents of 2019:On April 26, during a Tunisian Armed Forces CT mission in the Chaambi Mountains, a landmine exploded near a military vehicle, killing one soldier and wounding three.On June 27, two suicide bomb attacks struck central Tunis, targeting a police vehicle downtown and the office of the Ministry of Interior’s National Police CT Investigative Unit nearby.  The former attack led to the death of one municipal policeman and wounding three civilians; the latter injured three security officers and killed one.  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks.On September 23, an individual acting alone stabbed a military officer near a bus stop and proceeded to fatally stab a police officer near a courthouse in Bizerte.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, there were two legislative initiatives related to countering terrorism.  On January 10, the Parliament ratified amendments to the 2015 Countering Terrorism and Money Laundering Law.  With the amendments, the law now legally defines perpetrators of terrorist crimes, integrates juvenile justice into the Judicial Center for Combating Terrorism (POLE), and grants new powers to the National Counter-Terrorism Commission (CNLCT), including the decision to freeze the assets of persons suspected of terrorism-related crimes.  On May 17, the Tunisian government issued Decree 419 titled “UN Measures to Prevent Terrorists from Acquiring Weapons of Mass Destruction,” which, in addition to outlining steps to implement UN Security Council measures related to CT and counter-WMDs, extended the CNLCT’s authority to sanction persons or organizations engaged in material support for terrorism.The government’s CT efforts demonstrated notable increases in proactive CT operations and improved coordination between Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Defense security elements in 2019, resulting in significant arrests of terrorists, weapons seizures, and successful operations.  Major law enforcement actions and arrests included:On January 3, police officers engaged two terrorists belonging to Katibat Al Jihad Wal Tawheed, a recent splinter of Jund Al Khilafah, in Sidi Bouzid governorate.  Both individuals died after detonating their explosive belts.  Security officials seized a machine gun, remote-controlled IEDs, hunting rifles, ammunition, and a large sum of money.On March 19, MOI security forces carried out a pre-emptive security operation against Jund Al Khilafah on Mount Salloum, Kasserine governorate, killing its leader, Houssem Thelithi Mokni, and two other members.  The unit seized three firearms, ammunition, several detonators, grenades, and explosive belts.On May 1, a joint preemptive operation involving MOI security forces on Chaambi Mountain, Kasserine governorate, resulted in the capture of Raed Touati, a member of AQIM-aligned Uqba Ibn Nafaa.During June 27-28, in response to the twin suicide attacks in Tunis, security units conducted 493 raids resulting in the arrest of 25 wanted elements on the suspicion of belonging to a terrorist organization, glorification of terrorism, and terrorist offenses.  These arrests helped uncover a plot targeting Carthage Airport.On September 2, National Guard units in coordination with the Tunisian military conducted a CT operation west of Kasserine, killing three terrorists and seizing four rifles and three suicide belts.  One National Guard officer died.  According to the CT Judicial POLE, the three terrorists were Algerian nationals wanted since 2013.On October 20, National Guard units in coordination with the Tunisian military conducted a CT operation in Kasserine, killing one terrorist, Algerian national Mourad Ben Hamadi Chayib.During November 27-28, Tunisian security forces discovered a cache of more than six thousand rounds of 7.62-calibre ammunition buried in the desert outside the southwestern city of Douz.Border security remained a top emphasis of the Government of Tunisia in 2019 because of escalation in fighting in Libya and Algeria’s uncertain political transition.  The Tunisian Armed Forces consider border security their principal mission along with CT.  Along with the MOI’s National Guard, the Armed Forces successfully employed patrol craft, vehicles, weapons, and training in border security and CT operations throughout 2019.  On April 11, the southern electronic border surveillance system operation room in Gabes came online.  On October 3, a maritime coastal surveillance system operation center in Kelibia was inaugurated.  The complete maritime surveillance system will provide coverage across the entire Tunisian coast.According to the Ministry of Tourism, 8.3 million tourists visited Tunisia from January to November 2019, a 14 percent increase over the same period last year.  The most recent terrorist attack against tourists in Tunisia was in 2015.  Safeguarding tourist zones remained a Tunisian government priority in 2019.  Within the context of the G-7 mechanism for multilateral security assistance coordination, the UK-led Tourist Site Protection working group provided the MOI with vehicles for use near tourist beaches in Monastir, Nabeul, and Sousse, and helped train 81 security agents to work at archeological sites in 2019.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Tunisia is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Tunisian Financial Analysis Committee, is a member of the Egmont Group.  Tunisia is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG and successfully completed its FATF action plan and the FATF removed Tunisia from its grey-list at the October 2019 plenary meeting in Paris.On October 25, the CNLCT announced there were 138 Tunisians on the national list of “Individuals, Organizations and Entities Related to Terrorist Crimes.”  Of these, 107 Tunisians were residing domestically, 26 lived abroad, and five had fled to neighboring countries.  The total value of frozen assets amounts to approximately $106 million.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, Tunisia continued its concerted effort to prevent what it terms “radicalization” through youth and educational programs coordinated among its ministries and civil society organizations (CSOs).  On April 8, the Alternative Narrative Platform, an office within the Prime Ministry, launched its national CVE action plan in partnership with the Tunisian Broadcasting Institute to promote messages of tolerance, diversity, and acceptance across mass media platforms.  In October, the Ministry of Justice launched its Tawasol Project with assistance from the European Union, the Netherlands, and the UK.  The program will work with 60 prisoners in three prisons as a pilot to classify prisoners, teach communication techniques against “extremism,” and create prison research/vocation centers for inmate education.  The MOJ intends to expand the project to all its prisons by 2028.International and Regional Cooperation:  Tunisia will assume a seat during 2020 to 2021 on the UN Security Council representing both Africa and the Middle East, and it has been a participant in UN-led training on detecting and preventing terrorist travel.The United Arab Emirates government continued to prosecute multiple individuals for terrorism-related offenses in 2019.  In line with previous years, the UAE continued its collaboration with U.S. law enforcement on counterterrorism cases; its membership in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS; and its support for CVE and related platforms, such as the Sawab and Hedayah Centers, respectively.  The UAE remained co-chair of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s Communications Working Group, along with the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as co-chair of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s Stabilization Working Group with the United States and Germany.The government’s security apparatus continued monitoring suspected terrorists in the UAE and foiled potential terrorist attacks within its borders.  The UAE customs, police, and other security agencies improved border security and worked with financial authorities to counter terrorist finance.  UAE government officials worked closely with U.S. law enforcement counterparts to increase the UAE’s CT capabilities.  The UAE continued to support counterterrorism efforts in Yemen to counter AQAP and ISIS, including support to local forces in CT operations.  The drawdown of some UAE forces in Yemen and disbanding of some local security forces supported by the UAE following conflict between the Republic of Yemen Government and forces aligned with the Southern Transitional Council contributed to a reversal of territorial gains in the fight against AQAP and ISIS in Yemen, including in areas known to be historical safe havens for the groups.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist attacks reported in the UAE in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, the UAE continued to prosecute numerous individuals in terrorism-related cases using existing legislation.  International human rights NGOs and activists reported the UAE uses its CT and cyber-crime laws as cover to pursue cases against political dissidents and activists.The State Security Directorate (SSD) in Abu Dhabi and Dubai State Security (DSS) remained primarily responsible for CT law enforcement efforts.  Local, emirate-level police forces, especially Abu Dhabi Police and Dubai Police, are the first responders in such cases and often provided technical assistance to SSD and DSS, respectively.  Overall, the UAE security apparatus demonstrated capability in investigations, crisis response, and border security, and forces were trained and equipped to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist incidents.According to press reports, the Federal Appeal Court’s State Security Court examined new terrorism-related cases in 2019 and retried terrorism-related cases from 2018.  Most cases involved defendants accused of promoting or affiliating with UAE-designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS, AQAP, and al-Nusrah Front.As in previous years, the Government of the UAE worked closely with the United States, through DHS, to improve its border security posture.  Law enforcement information sharing between Abu Dhabi Police’s Criminal Investigations Division and DHS Homeland Security Investigations helped counter transnational criminal organizations and terrorist groups.  UAE ports of entry used an internal name-based watchlist system populated by local immigration, deportation, corrections, and security agencies to identify individuals who were prohibited from entering the country or were sought by UAE authorities.  Some human rights organizations claimed that activists, academics, and journalists who had written critically about UAE policy were included on such lists and barred from entry.  INTERPOL and GCC watchlists were incorporated into the UAE’s internal watchlist.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The UAE is a member of MENAFATF.  Its FIU, known as the Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Cases Unit (AMLSCU), is a member of the Egmont Group.  The UAE is also a member of the Defeat ISIS Coalition’s CIFG and the TFTC.In collaboration with other TFTC member states, the UAE in 2019 imposed one round of sanctions against individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian regime’s terror-support networks in the region.The UAE passed Cabinet Decision No. 10 of 2019, also known as the Implementing Regulation of Decree Federal Law No. 20 of 2018, on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Illegal Organizations and provided interpretive guidance to financial institutions on these regulatory changes.The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) announced a new initiative to supervise financial institutions sanctions screening capabilities.  Starting in the first quarter of 2020, CBUAE will use its own sanctions screening software as a baseline to test the sanctions screening capabilities of all UAE financial institutions regulated under the authority of the CBUAE.In partnership with UNODC, the AMLSCU launched an online platform called goAML to facilitate the receipt, analysis, and dissemination of suspicious transactions and activity reports related to money laundering and the financing of terrorism, to UAE law enforcement authorities. Countering Violent Extremism:  The UAE government continued to play a leadership role in global CVE efforts.  The UAE continued its support of Hedayah, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism, and the Sawab Center, a collaborative partnership with the United States to amplify credible voices to counter terrorist messaging online.  The government separately worked to amplify credible alternative narratives by supporting the fifth annual Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies, which gathered 800 scholars and religious figures from 120 countries.  Prominent UAE officials and religious leaders continued to publicly criticize and highlight the dangers of terrorist narratives.  Through the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments, the government regulated all mosque sermons and religious publications to “instill the principle of moderation in Islam.”  The UAE continued efforts to provide “moderate” religious education training to educators and imams from Afghanistan.The UAE declared 2019 the “Year of Tolerance” and organized public events at home and abroad to promote the values of tolerance, coexistence, and cooperation among peoples from all races and religions.  The UAE cabinet approved a national initiative to promote the role of the government as an incubator for tolerance, and the Emirate of Dubai hosted the World Tolerance Summit.  The UAE announced the construction of an “Abrahamic Family House” to promote interfaith harmony and commemorate the historic visit of Pope Francis to Abu Dhabi in February 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  The UAE has signed CT cooperation agreements with Egypt, New Zealand, Russia, India, Germany, South Korea, and Brazil.  The UAE government participated in several international conferences on combating terrorism, expressing the UAE’s strategy and efforts in combating terrorism.  The UAE hosted the annual Defeat-ISIS Coalition meeting in Abu Dhabi in October and an Arab League panel discussion on the role of media in combating terrorism in November.  It also continued to play a role in countering AQAP and ISIS-Yemen through the deployment of forces in south Yemen.Throughout 2019, AQAP, ISIS-Yemen, Hizballah, the IRGC-QF, and other Iran-backed terrorist groups continued to exploit the political and security vacuum created by the ongoing conflict between the Yemeni government under the leadership of President Abd Rabu Mansour Hadi, recognized by the UN Security Council as the legitimate government of Yemen, and the Iran-backed Houthi militants.  Additionally, IRGC-QF has exploited the conflict to expand its influence in Yemen.  UN and other reporting have highlighted the connection between the IRGC-QF and the Houthis, including the provision of lethal aid used by the Houthis to target civilian sites in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  Media reports suggest that other FTOs, such as Hizballah, may also be supporting the Houthi militants.The Republic of Yemen Government, in partnership with the Saudi-led coalition, controlled the majority of Yemeni territory at the end of 2019; however, in August the UAE-backed secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the Republic of Yemen Government’s temporary capital, Aden.  With the November 5 signing of the Riyadh Agreement between the Republic of Yemen Government and the STC, the two parties agreed to end three months of hostilities in Yemen’s South.  The agreement allowed for the return of the Republic of Yemen Government prime minister to Aden on November 18.  It also aims to produce a more inclusive, representative cabinet and bring all military forces under the Republic of Yemen Government umbrella.  Iran-backed Houthi militants controlled the capital of Sana’a and surrounding northwest highlands, and they largely controlled the port city of Hudaydah, among other areas.  AQAP retained areas of influence inside Yemen, though the terrorist group was pushed back by Republic of Yemen Government and UAE-backed local security forces over the course of the year.The Republic of Yemen Government cooperated with the U.S. government on CT efforts; however, because of the instability and violence in Yemen, as well as its own degraded capabilities, the Republic of Yemen Government cannot fully enforce CT measures across the country.  A large security vacuum persists, which provides AQAP and ISIS-Yemen room to operate.  Most counterterrorism gains in 2018 were reversed in 2019, as some UAE forces withdrew and other security forces supported by the UAE disbanded.  Republic of Yemen Government and tribal pressures continued to complicate AQAP’s freedom of movement.  AQAP and ISIS-Yemen continued to carry out terrorist attacks throughout the country, including in government-held territory.  UAE-backed Yemeni Security Belt Forces, which played a significant role in CT efforts, were used by the STC to exercise control over significant parts of Aden in August.  The November 2019 Riyadh Agreement aims to bring them under Republic of Yemen Government control.  ISIS-Yemen remained considerably smaller in size and influence compared with AQAP, but it remained operationally active and continued to claim attacks against AQAP, Yemeni security forces, and the Houthis militants.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  AQAP and ISIS-Yemen terrorists carried out hundreds of attacks throughout Yemen in 2019.  Methods included suicide bombers, VBIEDs, ambushes, armed clashes, kidnappings, and targeted assassinations.  Notable terrorist incidents from 2019 include:On April 2, unknown gunmen kidnapped and killed a patient at Al Sadaqah hospital in Aden.  The incident caused Doctors Without Borders to suspend all new admissions to the hospital.On August 1, ISIS-Yemen claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a police station in Aden.  The attackers used multiple suicide VBIEDs to attack a police station in Aden’s Omar al Mokhtar neighborhood, killing 11 people and injuring 29 others.On August 2, AQAP gunmen stormed al-Mahfad army base in southern Abyan province, killing 19 soldiers.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Yemen made no significant changes to its CT legal framework or to its law enforcement and border security procedures in 2019.  Yemen does not have comprehensive CT legislation.  Owing to a lack of resources and organization, police forces throughout the country struggle to exert authority.Draft CT legislation has been pending in the Parliament since 2008.  Before the political instability in Sana’a that drove the Republic of Yemen Government from the capital in 2015, the draft was under review by the three parliamentary subcommittees responsible for counterterrorism (Legal and Constitutional Affairs; Security and Defense; and Codification of Sharia Law).  The law would facilitate the detention of suspects and include mandatory sentencing for several terrorism-related crimes.  There have been no clear moves to implement legal structures compliant with UNSCRs 2178 and 2396 related to countering foreign terrorists and travel, although the Republic of Yemen Government continues to institute some noteworthy measures to combat terrorist travel.  There are limited commercial flights operating out of airports in Yemen, and the government does not have the capacity or resources to implement UNSCR 2309 mandates on aviation security.Before March 2015, Yemen’s National Security Agency and President’s Office drafted a National Counterterrorism Strategy.  A ministerial committee reviewed the draft but was unable to finalize it because of political instability.  Thus, Yemen’s National Counterterrorism Strategy had not been officially adopted or implemented by the end of 2019.Yemen employs the U.S.-provided PISCES system to secure borders and identify fraudulent travel documents.  Despite the conflict, Yemen has been able to maintain traveler screening at a limited number of points of entry.In past years, the Yemeni government’s Coast Guard played a critical role in interdicting weapons and other illegal materials destined for Yemen-based terrorist groups, although the nation’s maritime borders remained extremely porous.  The central-southern coast remains highly vulnerable to maritime smuggling of fighters, weapons, materials, and goods used to support AQAP and ISIS-Yemen.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Yemen is a member MENAFATF.In 2019, the Central Bank of Yemen committed to implementing International Monetary Fund Diagnostic Report recommendations to enhance AML/CFT capacity, but no specific steps have been undertaken to date.  Owing to a lack of judicial capacity and territorial control, the Yemeni government is unable to fully implement UNSCRs related to terrorist financing.  Since 2010, FATF has identified Yemen as a risk to the international financial system because of its strategic AML/CFT deficiencies.The government has committed with the STC to enhance management of state revenues and announced in December the formation of a committee authorized to inspect and audit customs and tax collection points to ensure that funds were not diverted from government coffers.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no significant changes in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Yemen joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2019.  The Republic of Yemen Government continued to cooperate with the GCC, the United States, and other donor countries as it concentrated on working toward a political solution to the conflict.  Despite the challenges, the Republic of Yemen Government remained a dependable international partner as it worked to reestablish the rule of law within the territory it holds.  Yemen, with the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, participates in the Yemen Security Working Group, which includes military and diplomatic representatives from its three member states, and develops several cooperative capacity-building initiatives for Yemeni military and security forces.  For example, in July, 15 Yemen Coast Guard personnel participated in a two-and-a-half week ship boarding and inspection course held in Aden and delivered by the UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime’s Global Maritime Crime Program.  In addition, around 150 Yemen Border Guard members participated in five Export Control and Related Border Security-funded iterations of Yemen Border Interdiction Training in Riyadh.  Yemen also belongs to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League.')"

    "complete_SA_text = ('SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIAOverviewIn addition to continued terrorist activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan, South Asia in 2019 saw a volatile mix of insurgent attacks punctuated by major incidents of terrorism in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (now known as the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir) and in Sri Lanka.  A February 14 suicide bombing attack against an Indian paramilitary convoy in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir led to military hostilities and heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.  Although ISIS lost the last remnants of its territory in Syria in March, it announced new branches in Pakistan and India in May and claimed responsibility for the Easter bombings in Sri Lanka in April.Although al-Qa’ida in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been seriously degraded, key figures among AQ’s global leadership, as well as its regional affiliate al-Qa’ida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), continued to operate from remote locations in the region that historically served as safe havens.Afghanistan continued to experience aggressive and coordinated terrorist attacks by ISIS’s branch in the region, ISIS Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), and by the Afghan Taliban, including the affiliated Haqqani Network (HQN).  Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) retained full responsibility for security in Afghanistan and, in partnership with NATO’s Resolute Support Mission, took aggressive action against terrorist elements across Afghanistan.  In offensives in late 2019, the ANDSF and the Taliban significantly degraded ISIS-K in Nangarhar province, denying ISIS territory, but the group continues to operate and regroup.While Pakistan continued to experience terrorist attacks, there were fewer attacks and casualties than in 2018, continuing an overall decline.  Pakistani military and security forces undertook CT operations against groups that conducted attacks within Pakistan, such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), ISIS-K, and the Balochistan Liberation Army.  Pakistan took modest steps in 2019 to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused militant groups from conducting large-scale attacks following the February attack on a security convoy in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir linked to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).  Pakistan took action against some externally focused groups, including indicting Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and associates in three separate terrorism financing cases.However, Pakistan remained a safe harbor for other regionally focused terrorist groups.  It allowed groups targeting Afghanistan, including the Afghan Taliban and affiliated HQN, as well as groups targeting India, including LeT and its affiliated front organizations, and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), to operate from its territory.  It did not take action against other known terrorists such as JeM founder and UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai attack “project manager” Sajid Mir, both of whom are believed to remain free in Pakistan.  Pakistan, however, did make some positive contributions to the Afghanistan peace process, such as encouraging Taliban reductions in violence.  Pakistan made some progress toward meeting the Action Plan requirements for the FATF, allowing it to avoid being blacklisted, but did not complete all Action Plan items in 2019.In August, India amended the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 1967 to authorize the designation of individuals as terrorists – which it did a month later by designating four terrorists, including the leaders of LeT and JeM.  The Indian Parliament also amended the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act of 2008 to provide the NIA the ability to investigate terrorism cases overseas.  The United States continues to build its strategic partnership with the Government of India, including through the bilateral Counterterrorism Joint Working Group meeting in March and the second 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in December.In April, ISIS-inspired terrorists conducted sophisticated suicide bombing attacks against churches and hotels across Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  It was a vivid example of ISIS’s determination, after the loss of its so-called “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq, to continue the fight from its global branches and networks and by inspiring attacks.In Maldives, the Solih administration continues to make progress bolstering its CT efforts.  In July, President Solih announced Maldives’ intent to facilitate the return and prosecution of Maldivian FTFs and families in Syria.  The Maldivian government also passed an amendment strengthening its 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act and designated 17 terrorist organizations in September.  In October, Maldivian police arrested Specially Designated Global Terrorist and ISIS recruiter Mohamad Ameen on “suspicion of spreading extremist ideology.”In Bangladesh, ISIS-affiliated terrorists claimed six IED attacks, five of which were directed against Bangladesh police.  ISIS’s At-Tamkin media outlet released a Bangla-language propaganda video outlining its campaign against the Bangladesh government and other declared enemies.Central Asian countries remained concerned about the potential spillover of terrorism from Afghanistan, as well as the potential threat posed by the return of their citizens who traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight with terrorist groups, including ISIS.  Between January and June, the Kazakhstan government led the world in FTF repatriations by bringing back 595 Kazakhstani fighters and family members from Syria, prosecuting those suspected of participating in terrorist activity abroad, and providing rehabilitation and reintegration services to the remainder.  Also in 2019, the Uzbekistan government repatriated 220 FTF family members from Iraq and Syria, mostly women and children, while the Tajikistan government repatriated 95.  The Kyrgyz Republic saw the return of about 300 FTFs and family members.In November, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack on the Tajik-Uzbek border.  Through the C5+1 (the United States plus the Central Asian countries), officials from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan participated in the associated C5+1 Security Working Group focused on regional cooperation on CT.The United States partners with Afghanistan in a bilateral CT effort through Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.  The U.S. military, along with 38 other Coalition nations, also supports the ANDSF through the NATO Resolute Support “Train, Advise, and Assist” mission.  In 2019, the Taliban and the affiliated HQN increased terrorist attacks targeting Afghan civilians, government officials, and members of the international community.  Additionally, ISIS-K continued to attack civilians and especially targeted religious minorities.  The enemy-initiated attack trend in 2019 defied its usual seasonal pattern; while in most years, such attacks decrease in cold-weather months, they remained consistently high following the summer fighting season.  ISIS-K, elements of al-Qa’ida, including affiliate AQIS, and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan, such as TTP, continued to use the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region as a safe haven.  Afghanistan is also the only member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS from South and Central Asia.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Attacks attributed to terrorist activity continued to increase in 2019.  While the majority of attacks occurred in Kabul, Jalalabad, and other major population centers, incidents also targeted Highway 1 (Afghanistan’s national Ring Road highway).  Militants conducted high-profile attacks through complex assaults involving multiple attackers wearing suicide vests to target ANDSF, Afghan government buildings, foreign governments, and soft civilian targets to include international organizations.  According to Resolute Support Mission reporting, between January 1 and September 30, insurgent and terrorist attacks were responsible for 1,618 civilians killed and an additional 4,958 wounded.  Among the significant terrorist incidents in 2019 were:On May 8, the Taliban attacked USAID-funded, U.S.-based aid organization Counterpart International in Kabul, killing four civilians and a policeman, and wounding 24 others.  All attackers were killed after a six-hour battle with Afghan security forces.On July 1, a Taliban attack against the Afghan National Army Logistic and Armory Directorate involved a VBIED and five gunmen attacking the compound.  The attack killed 40 civilians and wounded more than 100, including men, women, and children, in an adjacent school.On August 17, ISIS-K conducted a suicide bombing that targeted Shi’ite celebrants in a wedding hall in Kabul, killing at least 80 people and injuring more than 140.On September 2, the Taliban detonated a suicide car bomb at a facility in Kabul that housed numerous international organizations, killing 16 people and injuring more than 119.  Those killed included five Nepalis, two Britons, and a Romanian diplomat.On September 5, the Taliban detonated a suicide car bomb in Kabul killing 12 people, including an American paratrooper and a Romanian soldier.  The explosion also injured more than 40.On December 11, the Taliban conducted an attack on a hospital adjoining Bagram Airfield killing two and wounding 80 others, mostly civilians.  No Coalition fatalities were reported.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Afghan Attorney General’s Office investigates and prosecutes violations of the laws prohibiting membership in terrorist or insurgent groups, violent acts committed against the state, hostage taking, murder, and the use of explosives against military forces and state infrastructure.  These laws were codified into one Afghan Penal Code for national security crimes on May 15, 2017, in Official Gazette #1260. These laws include Crimes against the Internal and External Security of the State (1976 and 1987), Combat Against Terrorist Offences (2008), and Firearms, Ammunition, and Explosives (2005).Specialized police Crisis Response Units located in the Afghan cities of Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-e Sharif, and Herat continue to thwart and successfully respond to militant attacks.Afghanistan continued to face significant challenges in protecting its borders, particularly those with Pakistan and Iran.  Under the bilateral Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS), which met for the first time in July 2018, Afghan and Pakistani officials agreed in principle to create a mechanism for communication between security forces on each side of the border.  On June 10 at the APAPPS Review Session in Islamabad, the Afghan and Pakistani deputy foreign ministers met to discuss trade, transit, the peace process, refugees, and closer border security coordination.  Despite this review and discussions between the two governments to utilize APAPPS, progress through this forum remains slow.Afghanistan continued to process traveler arrivals and departures at major ports of entry using U.S.-provided PISCES border security management system, which currently operates at 13 ports of entry, including the airports of Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-Sharif.  The most recent implementation of PISCES was in October at the Gulum Khan border crossing of Khost province.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Afghanistan is a member of the APG.  In line with FATF recommendations, Afghanistan’s FIU, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Afghanistan (FinTRACA), conducted a money laundering and terrorist-financing risk assessment in 2019.  On May 15, the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee designated ISIS-K as the first ISIS affiliate to be designated by the UN.Afghan Peace Process:  Throughout 2019, the United States sought to negotiate an agreement with the Taliban that would commit the Taliban to take action against international terrorist groups, including not allowing those groups to recruit, train, or raise funds on Afghan territory, and to not host those groups.  In return for these commitments and for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations that would include the Afghan government, other Afghan leaders, and the Taliban, the United States would agree to a timeline for the conditions-based withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan.  Although the United States suspended talks following Taliban attacks in early September that were inconsistent with multiple rounds of serious negotiations, these talks were restarted in December following a series of goodwill gestures by the Taliban and Afghan government, including the release of one American and one Australian hostage, the release of Taliban-held ANDSF hostages, and the release of Afghan-held Taliban prisoners.Countering Violent Extremism:  A landmark July 6-8 intra-Afghan dialogue, hosted in Doha, Qatar, and organized by Germany, brought together representatives of the Afghan government, other Afghan leaders, civil society groups (including women’s groups), and the Taliban.  Participating in their personal capacities, the attendees agreed on the conditions necessary to reach a sustainable peace, and a roadmap for achieving peace.From April 28 to May 3, a Loya Jirga chaired by Mujahedin leader and Islamic scholar Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf included 3,200 religious leaders, politicians, and representatives who met to discuss peace and called for an immediate ceasefire between the government and militants.  The Jirga’s 3,200 delegates were divided into 51 committees that developed 23 recommendations urging a cease in violence between Afghan security forces and militants.  The Taliban condemned the Jirga as unrepresentative of the Afghan people.International and Regional Cooperation:  Afghanistan is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  In May, Afghan President Ghani agreed to participate in a trilateral meeting with Pakistan and the United States to discuss not only security but also prospective cooperation on economic growth and regional connectivity.Bangladesh experienced a small increase in terrorist activity in 2019.  ISIS claimed six IED attacks, five of which were directed at Bangladesh police.  ISIS’s At-Tamkin media outlet released a Bangla-language propaganda video outlining its campaign against the Bangladesh government and other declared enemies.  As in prior years, the Bangladesh government denied that Bangladesh-based terrorists have meaningful ties to transnational terror groups, including ISIS or AQIS.  In November, the Bangladesh government formally granted operational authority to a national Antiterrorism Unit.  Also in November, the CT Special Tribunal in Dhaka sentenced seven individuals to death for their supporting roles in the 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack, in which attackers claiming allegiance to ISIS killed 20 people, including one American.  However, ongoing deficits in Bangladesh’s judicial system contribute to a decade-long backlog of terrorism cases and a conviction rate estimated at less than 15 percent.  The Bangladesh government continued to articulate a “zero tolerance” policy toward terrorism and the use of its territory as a terrorist safe haven.  In December, the Bangladesh government, in concert with the U.S. Embassy, the UN, and other partners, hosted its inaugural National CVE Conference aimed at producing a national CVE strategy.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  From April to November, Bangladeshi militants detonated six IEDs.  Five were directed against the Bangladesh police, while one detonated at an Awami League office in Khulna.  ISIS claimed responsibility for these attacks, which caused several injuries but no deaths.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In 2019, Bangladesh’s criminal justice system was still in the process of fully implementing the Antiterrorism Act of 2009 as amended in 2012 and 2013.  A CT Special Tribunal authorized under the Act sentenced seven men to death for their supporting roles in the 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack.  Although Bangladesh’s Antiterrorism Act does not outlaw recruitment and travel in the furtherance of terrorism, the broad language of the Act provides several mechanisms by which Bangladesh can implement UNSCR 2396 on addressing FTFs.  Despite lacking laws specific to FTFs, Bangladesh arrested suspected FTFs or facilitators of such fighters on other charges under existing law.Bangladesh cooperated with the United States to strengthen control of its borders and ports of entry.  The international community remains concerned about security procedures at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.  In February, a man attempted to hijack a passenger aircraft in flight, having smuggled what authorities reported was a fake gun onto the aircraft.  There were several subsequent incidents in which passengers defeated screening protocols.  U.S.-trained explosive detection K9 teams are available to patrol Dhaka’s international airport but are not a permanent presence.  Bangladesh shared law enforcement information with INTERPOL but does not have a dedicated terrorist watchlist, though the United States and Bangladesh are collaborating on the development of a national level Alert List of known or suspected terrorists.  Bangladesh also does not systematically review or analyze API/PNR.Elements of the Bangladesh Police continued a campaign of arrests and raids against suspected militants.  Many suspects died in these operations, sometimes described as the result of “shootouts” or “crossfire” – often euphemisms for extrajudicial killings.  Observers questioned the veracity and significance of some of the reported CT operations, describing them as either staged by law enforcement or inaccurately portrayed by the media.In August, ISIS’s At-Tamkin media outlet released a Bangla-language video directed against the Bangladesh government, as well as foreign governments, religious minorities, and other alleged enemies of Islam.  In September, Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Counterterrorism and Transnational Crime Unit arrested several individuals who allegedly produced the video.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Bangladesh is a member and current co-chair of the APG.  The Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit is a member of the Egmont Group. There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Bangladeshi organizations continued cooperative activities through the Country Support Mechanism under GCERF, a public-private global fund to support local, grassroots CVE efforts in at-risk communities.  The Ministry of Religious Affairs and the National Committee on Militancy, Resistance, and Prevention work with imams and religious scholars to build public awareness against terrorism.  The police engaged religious leaders to counter terrorist propaganda with scripture-based messages and engaged imams to speak to surrendered militants to explain that the Quran does not support terrorist violence.  They also continued community policing efforts.  Law enforcement authorities worked with local universities to identify missing students and curb terrorist radicalization among university students.  Local research institutions, including private think tanks and both public and private universities, continued to engage in CVE-related research.  In December, the Counterterrorism and Transnational Crime Unit partnered with the U.S. Embassy, the UN, and various CSOs to draft a national CVE strategy for submission to the Bangladesh government.The Bangladeshi cities of Dhaka North, Dhaka South, and Narayanganj are members of the SCN.In 2019, India suffered terrorist attacks in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the northeastern Indian states, and parts of central India.  The Government of India continued to apply sustained pressure to detect, disrupt, and degrade terrorist activities within its borders.  Prime Minister Modi and other senior Indian leaders made numerous statements to condemn domestic terrorist attacks and bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorism, in cooperation with the United States and other like-minded countries.The United States and India increased CT cooperation in 2019.  In March, the United States and India held the annual Counterterrorism Joint Working Group in Washington, D.C., meeting concurrently with the second U.S.-India Designations Dialogue.  Both countries announced their intent to prevent terrorists from obtaining access to weapons of mass destruction and underscored their respective commitments to the implementation of UNSCR 2396.  In December, the United States hosted the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, in which the ministers called for concerted action against all terrorist networks, including AQ, ISIS/Daesh, LeT, JeM, HQN, Hizb-ul Mujahideen, and TTP.2019 Terrorist Incidents: On February 14, a suicide bomber from the terror group JeM, using a VBIED, killed 40 Indian soldiers from the Central Reserve Police Force in Pulwama, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.On April 9, in southern Chhattisgarh, Maoist terrorists triggered an IED, killing a Bharatiya Janata Party Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly member and four others.On May 1, Maoist terrorists used landmines to kill 15 members of Maharashtra state’s counter-insurgency commando unit.On October 29, suspected terrorists killed five migrant laborers, all from the eastern state of West Bengal, in the southern portion of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The 1967 Unlawful Activities Prevention Act was amended in August 2019 to allow for the designation of individuals as terrorists.  The Indian Parliament passed amendments to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act of 2008 to give NIA the ability to investigate terrorism cases overseas.  The newly amended NIA Act can further improve bilateral law enforcement cooperation.  The efficacy and impact of the newly amended laws will likely be tested in ongoing terrorism cases in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, as well as cases involving what India characterizes as “left-wing extremists,” and cases involving insurgencies in Northeast India.India’s state governments continue to be responsible for law and order.  India’s state-level law enforcement agencies play a significant role in detecting, deterring, and preventing acts of terrorism.  These state agencies have varying degrees of capability.  State antiterrorism squads were created after 2008 for rapid first response.At the central government level, NIA is the lead law enforcement investigative agency.  The National Security Guard (NSG) retains the mandate for nationwide response as the sole federal contingency force.  However, despite rigorous training, NSG’s rapid response capability is challenged relative to India’s geography and the NSG’s independent logistics capacity.  In addition, the NSG may not testify in judicial proceedings.Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats despite some gaps in intelligence and information sharing.  In 2016, India and the United States signed an arrangement to exchange terrorism screening information, and India continues to work on implementation.  Larger Indian states have established their own state-level Multi Agency Centers and provided near-real-time information on terrorism to Indian law enforcement agencies.The U.S. government engaged with the Indian government to improve border security and information-sharing capabilities.  India is in the process of improving its ability to detect and deter terrorist travel by using watchlists, implementing biographic and biometric screening capabilities at ports of entry, and expanding information sharing.  Owing to resource constraints, Indian security forces have a limited capacity to conduct maritime security, although India’s ability to patrol its land border improved because of better coordination between border security forces and Indian law enforcement agencies.  Bilateral capacity building is ongoing with Indian government personnel.  Outreach training programs are ensuring Indian border security officials are collecting and using API and PNR to help identify malafide travelers.Indian CT forces, at the federal and state levels, were active in detecting and disrupting transnational and regional terrorist groups, such as ISIS, its local affiliate ISIS-Bangladesh, and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).  Between February and June 2019, Indian security forces detained nine suspected JMB and ISIS-Bangladesh terrorists from sites across India.  The arrested individuals were allegedly planning attacks, ranging from jailbreaks to freeing imprisoned JMB and ISIS-Bangladesh members to attacking Indian security forces in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.Following the April 2019 Easter bombings in Sri Lanka, the NIA conducted searches in Tamil Nadu and Kerala to investigate a suspected ISIS cell.  One person was arrested in Palakkad, Kerala, on April 29 and admitted he was planning a suicide attack in Kerala.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  India is a member of the FATF and of two FATF-style regional bodies:  the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) and APG.  India’s FIU is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, four Indian states (Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Telangana) formulated CVE strategies.  Indian programs continued to target disaffected sectors of Indian society that were at the highest risk of vulnerability for terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  Indian government officials remain concerned about the use of the internet for terrorist purposes – including social media and messaging apps such as WhatsApp – as well as for fomenting inter-religious tension.  India’s law enforcement officers discussed emerging threats and steps to prevent online terrorist recruitment and radicalization with representatives from global social media companies on a regular basis.  Indian officials reported online terrorist radicalization in conflict-free zones, particularly in southern Indian states, throughout the year.  India’s approach focused heavily on content removal and even shutting down internet access in certain regions.  Mumbai remains the only Indian participant in the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  India is a founding member of the GCTF and participated in the GCTF, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and other UN fora on counterterrorism in 2019.  India continued to use multilateral fora and bilateral visits to highlight terrorism concerns and impacts.  India also continued to lead efforts to condemn terrorism and urge tangible steps against the threat in meetings of ASEAN.  In November, India hosted the first Counterterrorism Table-top Exercise in the Quad country format (the United States, Australia, India, and Japan).  U.S. Special Forces continued an annual exercise in Washington State alongside Indian Special Forces, which focused on CT operations in an urban environment, and also conducted a Joint Combined Exercise Training with the NSG in Hyderabad.Kazakhstan remained on guard against the potential for attacks by FTFs returning from war zones in the Middle East and Afghanistan, as well as homegrown terrorist attacks.  Between January and June, the government repatriated 595 Kazakhstani FTFs and family members from Syria, prosecuting those suspected of participation in terrorist activity abroad and providing rehabilitation and reintegration services to the remainder.  The government continued to implement its five-year (2018-2022) program against “religious extremism and terrorism;” however, the strategy’s continued restrictions on religious practice have prompted concerns among some outside experts that the government’s efforts may be counterproductive.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Kazakhstan in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Kazakhstan has a comprehensive CT legal framework.  The country’s lead agency for counterterrorism is the Committee for National Security (KNB), which coordinates efforts among multiple state agencies and at the local level.  In 2018, the government approved an ambitious five-year, $900 million program to counter “religious extremism and terrorism.”  Law enforcement officers and prosecutors continued to have wide discretion to determine what qualifies as “terrorism” or “extremism,” leaving political opponents and promoters of unsanctioned religious groups vulnerable to prosecution.Kazakhstani law bans citizens from fighting in foreign wars.  In 2017, the president signed a law that allows the government to deprive Kazakhstanis of citizenship if they are convicted of a range of “grave terrorism and extremism-related crimes.”  The government has not yet deprived anyone of citizenship in connection with such cases.  The government takes a two-pronged approach to citizens returning from Iraq and Syria, offering rehabilitation services to some and arresting and prosecuting others.  Between January and June, Kazakhstan carried out “Operation Zhusan,” which repatriated 595 Kazakhstani citizens from Syria, including 33 male FTFs.  In November, the government facilitated the return of 14 Kazakhstani children from Iraq, where their mothers were serving sentences on terrorism-related charges.  The same month, KNB publicly estimated that more than 90 Kazakhstani citizens remained in Syria, in addition to six women imprisoned in Iraq.Law enforcement units demonstrated a strong capacity to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist incidents.  The government’s CT plan allowed for enhanced interagency cooperation, coordination, and information sharing, but the extent to which this occurred remained unknown.In January, KNB reported the arrest of Tajik citizens accused of planning a terrorist attack in Almaty; in September, seven individuals received prison terms ranging from 12 to 18 years in connection with the plot.  In June, the Penitentiary Committee reported that approximately 600 people were serving sentences for terrorism and “extremism.”  Courts continued to deliver harsh sentences for the promotion of “extremism” online.  For example, in August an Almaty court sentenced eight men to prison terms ranging from five to eight years on charges of promoting terrorism and religious hatred for sharing religious content that the government considered inflammatory in a WhatsApp group.  In many cases, the nature of such charges is difficult to verify and, in some cases, appeared to be connected to political opposition activity.  Local researchers estimate that as many as 90 percent of charges filed under laws against terrorism and “extremism” do not involve violent acts or planned violent acts.Kazakhstan’s Border Guard Service (BGS), part of the KNB, uses specialized passport control equipment, allowing officers to check for fraudulent documents.  Through the first 10 months of 2019, BGS officers detected approximately three dozen cases of foreign travelers attempting to enter or transit Kazakhstan with fake documents, such as two Iranian women with fraudulent Italian passports detained at Almaty airport in October.  In recent years, Kazakhstan has strengthened security on its southern border by adding radar systems, inspection equipment and vehicles, and specialized mobile inspection groups.  The government proactively worked to prevent Kazakhstanis from traveling to fight abroad in Syria and Iraq in keeping with UNSCR 2178.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Kazakhstan belongs to the EAG.  The Crime Statistics Committee of the Prosecutor General’s Office reported that three terrorist financing cases were transferred to the court system during the first 10 months of 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Kazakhstan’s five-year strategy places a heavy emphasis on law enforcement.  The strategy focuses on teaching government sanctioned versions of Islam to youth and providing alternatives to “radicalism” through social programs and economic opportunities.  The government’s Committee on Religious Affairs conducted direct outreach in communities across the country.  The government continued to implement rehabilitation and reintegration programs for individuals convicted of “extremism”-related offenses and their relatives.  To assist with the rehabilitation and reintegration of Kazakhstani women and children repatriated from Syria, the government established 17 centers throughout the country to provide mental health services, religious instruction, and other services.The Government of Kazakhstan censored online content to reduce “extremist” messaging.  Religious experts associated with government institutions created groups on social networks, where they posted information and answered user questions about “religious extremism.” Committee on Religious Affairs officials provided training for local imams, NGOs, and the media.  On December 10-11, the government hosted a regional SCN workshop in Almaty on terrorist rehabilitation and reintegration.International and Regional Cooperation:  Kazakhstani agencies partnered with the United States and international organizations such as UNDP, UNODC, and the OSCE on a variety of CVE and terrorist travel prevention projects.  As a member of the C5+1 diplomatic platform, Kazakhstan participates in the associated C5+1 Security Working Group, which focuses on regional CT cooperation.  In December 2019, KNB agreed to work with the United States to establish a National Intelligence Fusion Cell in Nur-Sultan.  With U.S. training and equipment assistance, the cell will consolidate intelligence from the Ministry of Defense, BGS, KNB, and international sources to enhance regional CT efforts.  Kazakhstan also hosted a UNODC-administered regional workshop on detection and prevention of terrorist travel in Almaty in April 2019.  Kazakhstan also participates in CT-related exercises and training through membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.During the 2019 CIS Summit, Kazakhstan signed a cooperative agreement between the CIS members to jointly combat terrorism, including preventive measures for “countering extremism, radicalization of the population,” financing terrorism, as well as involving civil society and mass media, holding special trainings, and the use of modern technologies for timely response to potential threats.The Kyrgyz Republic’s CT efforts continue to focus on rooting out “extremists,” CVE, limiting the flow of Kyrgyz FTFs, and preventing those returning from conflicts abroad from engaging in terrorist activities.  While the Kyrgyz Republic is concerned about ISIS, ISIS-K, and other terrorist groups, including from Afghanistan, it has not contributed to Defeat-ISIS Coalition efforts or U.S. CT operations, due in part to a lack of resources.  Terrorist attacks in the country remain rare, but the August 2016 suicide bombing against the Chinese Embassy in Bishkek and continued reports of terrorism-related arrests in 2019 – primarily FTFs returning from conflict zones – underscore the potential threat facing the country.  The Kyrgyz government restricts public information on national security issues, making it very difficult to assess the efficacy of its CT operations and the true extent of the threat.  The country remains vulnerable to transnational threats, especially in the remote South, where ill-defined and porous borders allow for the relatively free movement of people and illicit goods in and out of the country.  According to government statistics, approximately 850 Kyrgyz citizens have left the country to join ISIS or other terrorist groups.  Most experts believe the true number is higher.  The Kyrgyz government faces limitations on its ability to prosecute and rehabilitate returning FTFs due to a lack of expertise, resources, and potential shortcomings in the legal framework.  The country has seen the return of approximately 300 FTFs and family members.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  As a part of ongoing criminal justice reform, the new criminal code entered into force on January 1, which decreased criminal penalties for several terrorism-related crimes.  The updated law governing “extremist materials” now requires that law enforcement agencies demonstrate an intent to distribute “extremist materials” to justify the arrest of a suspect.  Prior to the changes to the law, police were authorized to arrest suspects based on simple possession.  Arrests have dropped sharply, and local media reported a total of only six prosecutions under the new law. There were no reports in 2019 of the government using CT laws to prosecute political opponents.In 2018, the government reportedly installed three sets of electronic gates at the Manas Airport in Bishkek and two at the Osh airport for verification of biometric passports of Kyrgyz citizens. There is no information indicating that the government is utilizing these e-gates to scan passengers against a terrorist watchlist.  The government has expressed interest in acquiring an API/PNR system for commercial flights, but this initiative would require significant donor support.  International organizations and host country contacts have expressed concerns that the Prosecutor General’s Office and State Committee for National Security (GKNB) lack the adequate tools or legal framework to properly prosecute citizens suspected of committing terrorist acts abroad.  There were no other changes to border security since 2018.Authorities continued to report a slow but steady stream of terrorism-related arrests in 2019, many of which involved Kyrgyz and foreign citizens who reportedly fought in Syria.  According to media reports, there are 44 people currently in prison after returning from fighting in Syria.  During the year, security services reportedly arrested several FTFs upon their return from Syria as they attempted to cross the border.  These suspects reportedly planned to receive instructions on the organization of terrorist activities in Kyrgyz or in the Commonwealth of Independent States region.  In October, the GKNB reported to the Kyrgyz parliament that 16 people involved in terrorist organizations had been detained – 11 on terrorism charges and five for “religious extremism.”  The GKNB reported that, during the first nine months of the year, the government seized 399 pieces of “extremist materials” but, due to the recent changes to the “extremism” law, did not initiate criminal cases.  In November, local media reported that authorities uncovered an ISIS sleeper cell established by a Kyrgyz citizen who was recruiting compatriots to carry out terrorist attacks in the Kyrgyz Republic.In September, the U.S. Departments of State and Homeland Security, as well as ODNI, conducted a joint review of the Kyrgyz Republic’s compliance with U.S. identity-management protocols and information sharing procedures as outlined in Executive Order 13780 and Presidential Proclamation 9645.  The review identified a number of key areas that did not sufficiently meet the outlined standards, including lack of a documented process for regularly and proactively providing information to the U.S. government about Known or Suspected Terrorists (KSTs); failure to issue electronic passports for Ordinary/Regular and for other major classes of passport, such as Diplomatic, Official, and Service passports; and failure to report lost and stolen travel documents to INTERPOL on an average of at least once a month (every 30 days), among other shortcomings.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the EAG.  There were no significant changes to the Kyrgyz government’s efforts and capacity related to CFT in 2019.  In 2019, the FIU lodged 169 money laundering reports and 118 terrorism financing reports and sent 558 financial investigative requests to relevant law enforcement bodies.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Kyrgyz government’s national program and action plan on countering terrorism was in its second year of implementation in 2019. Approval of the program and action plan was considered a positive first step in establishing a coordinated national strategy, but as year two comes to a close, the government has done little to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  Civil society has routinely expressed concerns that the government is using the national program and action plan to muzzle free speech and to stigmatize ethnic minorities.The Ministry of Education, in cooperation with the State Commission for Religious Affairs (SCRA), started implementing a new curriculum for high school-aged students on “moderate” Islam and identifying terrorist recruitment tactics.  The Ministry of Interior and the SCRA, often in cooperation with local religious leaders and civil society, continue to host CVE roundtables and seminars and produce public awareness and counter-messaging material distributed across a range of media platforms, with much of the focus on preventing radicalization among youth and women.  The Prosecutor General’s Office reported in October that the Kyrgyz courts, in coordination with security agencies, blocked at least 64 websites and 233 social media accounts that were spreading “extremist material,” though a local NGO reported the government has blocked 359 websites, including relatively large domains.  The Kyrgyz government cooperates with the UN, OSCE and other international organizations and foreign governments to facilitate CVE training and other CVE-related assistance programs.UNODC continues to support the Kyrgyz Prison Service in the development of strategies to manage the spread of extremism among prisoners and prevent radicalization, in line with international norms. The UNODC is now implementing a program to prepare the Kyrgyz prison service for the eventual return of FTFs.  The program will include training, security upgrades, and the implementation of internationally recognized best practices for the incarceration of terrorists.International and Regional Cooperation:  In 2019, the Kyrgyz Republic participated in a variety of CT activities and trainings organized by the U.S. government, UNODC, the OSCE, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), CIS, and SCO.  The Kyrgyz military allocated the vast majority of its CT training resources to exercises dominated by Russia.  The Kyrgyz Republic participated in seven international CT training events for military or law enforcement in 2019.  These exercises included bilateral CT training exercises with Russia, India, Kazakhstan, and – for the first time ever for the Kyrgyz Republic – China.  During the 2019 CIS Summit, the Kyrgyz president signed a cooperative agreement between CIS members to jointly combat terrorism, including through preventive measures for “countering extremism, radicalization of the population,” and financing terrorism, as well as involving civil society and mass media, holding special trainings, and the use of modern technologies for timely response to potential threats.In 2019, the Government of Maldives’s CT efforts concentrated on CVE and limiting the flow of FTFs.  Those within the penal system or involved in criminal gangs are at a heightened risk of terrorist radicalization.  The government claims that 188 cases related to “religious extremism” were reported between January 1, 2014, and October 31, 2019.  Of these, 14 were brought forward for prosecution.In October, Maldivian police arrested ISIS-K recruiter Mohamad Ameen on “suspicion of spreading extremist ideology.”  Ameen recruited for ISIS in Syria, Afghanistan, and Maldives.  Media reports also alleged that Ameen was suspected of involvement in the September 2007 Sultan Park bombing in Malé.In October, Maldives passed an amendment strengthening its 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act.  The amendment clarified the definition of terrorism, expanded the number of chargeable offenses related to terrorism, and introduced a monitoring mechanism to prevent politically motivated prosecutions.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Maldives in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Anti-Terrorism Act is the primary legislation for preventing and prosecuting terrorism.  In October, the government passed an amendment strengthening the ATA.  This amendment authorizes the Maldives Police Service (MPS) to make warrantless arrests for criminal acts defined as terrorism; criminalizes supporting “extremist” ideologies, departing for a war zone without government authorization, assisting individuals attempting to join militant groups, and withholding information regarding terrorism from authorities; and introduces longer prison sentences for terrorism.  The amendment requires the establishment of a rehabilitation and reintegration center for returning Maldivian FTFs, including a separate space for women and children deemed victims who did not commit acts of terrorism.  The law also creates a new CT risk assessment committee to assess whether repatriated individuals engaged in acts of terrorism or might be inclined to do so in the future.  Parliament was given oversight authority through a monitoring mechanism in the amendment to prevent politically motivated prosecutions such as those that occurred in 2018 and previously.In September, the government designated 17 terrorist organizations under the ATA, criminalizing participation in, or support to, such organizations.In September, the Presidential Commission on Deaths and Enforced Disappearances released its findings regarding the 2014 disappearance of Maldivian journalist Ahmed Rilwan, concluding he was abducted and killed by a Maldivian terrorist group linked to  al-Qa’ida.  The commission asked the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) to appeal the acquittal of two suspects accused of involvement in the killing and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute additional individuals suspected of involvement.In November 2018, the Criminal Court ordered the conditional release of two Maldivians charged in November 2017 with conspiring with ISIS to launch a suicide attack in Malé, based on their treatment during detention.  The Maldivian High Court reversed this decision in April and ordered the two individuals detained for the duration of their trials.The MPS is responsible for CT investigations.  It transfers cases to the PGO for the duration of trials.  Responsibility for CT operations, including investigations, primarily rests with MPS.  The Maldives National Defense Force (MNDF), including the marines and coast guard, are responsible for CT response.  The MNDF conducts routine Subject Matter Expert Exchanges and Joint Combined Exercise and Training engagements with U.S. forces focused on CT operations.  The engagements also enhance maritime security capabilities to increase Maldives domain awareness and security.  Maldives and the United States partnered in 2019 to upgrade the U.S.-provided PISCES integrated border management system.  Information sharing on potential security threats between Maldivian security agencies has improved but remains a challenge.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Maldives is a member of the APG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  In July, President Solih announced Maldives’ intent to facilitate the return and prosecution of Maldivian FTFs and families in Syria.  According to MPS Commissioner Hameed’s December 16 public remarks, there are approximately 1,400 “religious extremists” located in the Maldives.  The Maldives’ National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) held numerous regional workshops and capacity building exercises with both public and private sector groups, to include counter-narrative creation, the role of educators in countering “extremism,” and aviation security.  In October, President Solih announced a five-year CVE strategic action plan, designating the NCTC as the national coordination body for these efforts.   Malé is a member of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Government officials participated in and jointly hosted multiple international and regional workshops on CT efforts.  In February 2019, a joint report was issued by the NCTC, UNDP, and Government of Japan on youth vulnerability in the Maldives.  This report highlighted concerns over the increasing use of religion as a political weapon and the increasing influence of Salafism.  It also highlighted concern about the number of foreign preachers present in the Maldives and their role in recruitment for terrorist organizations.  In October, CTED conducted a visit to examine issues relating to CVE.  The NCTC, in conjunction with CTED, hosted a three-day regional workshop on obtaining electronic evidence in CT investigations.  Additionally, in October, the government concluded an agreement with the Government of Japan for $4.6 million in Japanese aid to bolster CT efforts.Nepal experienced no acts of international terrorism in 2019.  Political violence in Nepal remained small in scale and involved attacks on large-scale infrastructure, government offices, or locations affiliated with political parties or officials.  Violence occurring on or around the 2019 by-elections focused on voter intimidation and, in some cases, political extortion.  The Government of Nepal attributed the majority of the attacks to the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), a political faction better known as “Biplav,” led by Netra Bikram Chand.  The CPN split from the former Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) in 2015.  Nepal’s security services continue to monitor the Biplav Group, an insurgent group that sometimes engages in terrorism to attempt to achieve its goals.  Due to the open border with India and insufficient security protocols at the country’s sole international airport in Kathmandu, Nepal could be used as a transit or staging point for international terrorists.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Domestic incidents included small bombings in various locations throughout the country, for which authorities blamed the Biplav Group.  The attacks employed small, real, or hoax IEDs.  In total, Embassy Kathmandu, with assistance from Nepali law enforcement contacts, attributed an estimated 34 IEDs, 5 hoaxes, and 29 arson attacks to Biplav in 2019.On February 22, a series of 15 IED or arson attacks on cell phone towers owned by telecommunications service provider Ncell took place across Nepal, killing one person and injuring two others.Throughout the year, Biplav organized numerous nation-wide protests, which were frequently accompanied by IED attacks and other forms of violence.  One notable protest began on May 27 and lasted two days.  The protests resulted in a series of three IED explosions targeting government offices and Nepal Communist Party (NCP, not to be confused with the Community Party of Nepal) headquarters in Kathmandu, killing four and injuring seven.  The Home Ministry announced that 15 Biplav members had been arrested in connection with the May 27 and 28 explosions.On July 30-31 Biplav again targeted Ncell, carrying out a number of arson and IED attacks in the central region of Nepal as part of a nation-wide protest.  The attacks destroyed 22 cell towers.During the by-elections on November 30, there were approximately nine instances of IEDs, including one hoax, primarily targeting polling station locations.  It is widely assessed that the attacks were intended to intimidate political candidates, convince voters to stay home, and undermine the elections.Most recently, on December 14 an IED exploded in Dhanusha, killing three people and injuring four.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no changes in Nepal in 2019.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Nepal is a member of the APG.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Nepal does not employ strategic communications to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  There are no government or civil society programs in Nepal to counter terrorist recruitment or rehabilitate former terrorists.  The government generally does not view terrorism, specifically “extremist” ideology originating from conflict or instability in the Middle East, as a significant threat in Nepal.  Nepal appears to be largely infertile soil for terrorism propagated by international terrorist organizations.  A more significant threat is non-Nepali international terrorist groups using Nepal as a transit or staging point or soft target.International and Regional Cooperation:  Nepal is a signatory of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism.  INTERPOL hosts an annual regional CT seminar to which the Nepal Police sends two to three officers.Pakistan continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups.  It allowed groups targeting Afghanistan, including the Afghan Taliban and affiliated HQN, as well as groups targeting India, including LeT and its affiliated front organizations, and JeM, to operate from its territory.Pakistan took modest steps in 2019 to counter terror financing and to restrain some India-focused militant groups following the February attack on a security convoy in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir claimed by Pakistan-based JeM.  Thus far, however, Islamabad has yet to take decisive actions against Indian- and Afghanistan-focused militants who would undermine their operational capability.  The Pakistani government also played a constructive role in U.S.-Taliban talks in 2019.  Pakistan’s progress on the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter terrorism remains unfulfilled – specifically its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay and discrimination.  While Pakistani authorities indicted LeT co-founder Hafiz Saeed and 12 of his associates on December 11, they have made no effort to use domestic authorities to prosecute other terrorist leaders such as JeM founder Masood Azhar and Sajid Mir, the mastermind of LeT’s 2008 Mumbai attacks, both of whom are widely believed to reside in Pakistan under the protection of the state, despite government denials.Pakistan experienced significant terrorist threats in 2019, although the number of attacks and casualties was lower than in 2018, continuing an overall year-on-year decline.  Major terrorist groups focused on conducting attacks in Pakistan included Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP or Pakistani Taliban) and ISIS-K.  Separatist militant groups conducted terrorist attacks against varied targets in Balochistan and Sindh provinces.  Terrorists used a range of tactics to attack individuals, markets, police checkpoints, and places of worship, including IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide bombings, and targeted assassinations.In June 2018, the FATF placed Pakistan on its “gray list” and issued an Action Plan directing Pakistan to take specific steps by September 2019 to address strategic deficiencies in its CFT efforts.  The FATF expressed serious concern at its October 2019 plenary about Pakistan’s continued deficiencies but noted it had made some progress and extended the deadline for full Action Plan implementation to February 2020.In 2018, Pakistan was designated as a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. It was re-designated as a CPC in 2019.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Pakistan experienced numerous terrorist attacks in 2019.  The following examples include some of the more destructive and high-profile attacks and demonstrate a variety of methods, targets, and perpetrators:On May 8, a suicide bomber killed at least 10 (including police officers and security guards) and wounded at least 24 others in an attack at Lahore’s Data Darbar Sufi shrine. Hizbul Ahrar, a faction of TTP, claimed responsibility for the attack, specifying that the target was law enforcement officers and not civilians.On May 11, three militants killed five (including a Pakistani Navy officer) and injured six in an attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel in Gwadar. The Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack, stating the targets were Chinese and other foreign investors.On July 21, two back-to-back attacks in Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, killed 10 and injured 30. Unidentified gunmen on motorbikes opened fire on a police checkpoint killing two police officers.  A suicide bomber later detonated an explosive device at the hospital where first responders transported victims of the first attack.  TTP claimed responsibility for the attack.On August 16, a timed explosive at Quetta’s Al-Haj mosque detonated, killing four (including the brother of Afghan Taliban chief Mullah Haybatullah) and injuring 25 others. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Pakistani government continued to implement the Antiterrorism Act of 1997, the National Counterterrorism Authority (NACTA) Act, the 2014 Investigation for Fair Trial Act, and 2014 amendments to the Antiterrorism Act (ATA), all of which give law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts enhanced powers in terrorism cases.Military, paramilitary, and civilian security forces conducted CT operations throughout Pakistan against anti-state militants.  Pakistani law allows for preventive detention, permits the death penalty for terrorism offenses, and authorizes special Anti-Terrorism Courts to try terrorism cases.  Military courts established in 2015 under the National Action Plan to try civilians accused of terrorism ceased operation March 31.Pakistan collects biometric information at land crossings through its International Border Management Security System.  Authorities had limited ability to detect smuggling by air travel.  The Customs Service attempted to enforce anti-money laundering laws and foreign exchange regulations at all major airports, in coordination with other agencies.  Customs managed the entry of dual-use chemicals for legitimate purposes through end-use verification, while also attempting to prevent their diversion for use in IEDs.  Consistent with UNSCR 2178, returning FTFs may be prosecuted under Pakistani law.  NACTA is responsible for compiling and verifying data on these individuals.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Pakistan is a member of the APG.  Since June 2018, FATF has identified Pakistan as a jurisdiction with strategic deficiencies in its CFT system.  In 2019, Pakistan made some progress toward meeting the action plan requirements for the FATF, allowing it to avoid being blacklisted, but did not complete all action plan items.  In early 2019, Pakistan issued, inter alia, a statutory regulatory ordinance directing immediate implementation of sanctions against individuals and entities designated under UNSCR 1267.  In October 2019, APG published a Mutual Evaluation Report that reviewed Pakistan’s compliance with FATF standards and the effectiveness of Pakistan’s AML/CFT system.Countering Violent Extremism:  The government operated five de-radicalization camps offering “corrective religious education,” vocational training, counseling, and therapy.  A Pakistani NGO administered the juvenile-focused Sabaoon Rehabilitation Center in Swat Valley, which it founded in partnership with the Pakistani military.Some madrassas reportedly continued to teach “extremist” doctrine.  The National Action Plan directs increased government supervision of madrassas, and there was evidence of continued government efforts to increase regulation.  Security analysts and madrassa reform proponents observed, however, that many madrassas failed to register with the government or provide documentation of their sources of funding or to limit their acceptance of foreign students to those with valid visas, a background check, and the consent of their governments, as required by law.The Pakistani cities of Nowshera, Peshawar, and Quetta are members of the SCN.International and Regional Cooperation:  Pakistan participated in several multilateral fora where CT cooperation was discussed, including the GCTF, the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process, and the ASEAN Regional Forum.  Pakistan has been slated to host the next summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the first since 2016, when all other SAARC member states boycotted the planned Islamabad summit following terrorist attacks on Indian security personnel committed by Pakistani groups.ISIS-inspired terrorists conducted a series of suicide attacks against churches and hotels across Sri Lanka on Easter Day, resulting in hundreds of casualties.  Then ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi publicly praised the attacks, illustrating that ISIS remains determined, following its defeat in Syria and Iraq, to continue the fight from its global branches and networks and by inspiring attacks.  The attacks led to isolated outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence, which the government made efforts to stop, though some observers deemed these efforts insufficient.  Sri Lanka also conducted prosecutions against members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a terrorist insurgent group that fought the government for 26 years until its defeat in 2009.Following the Easter attacks, Sri Lanka sought to improve its CT efforts by engaging the United States on improving border security and soliciting assistance for the Attorney General’s office, which is charged with prosecuting the attack perpetrators.  Sri Lanka is not a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, but participated as an observer at the Political Directors meeting in June.  The country’s secretary of defense and inspector general of police at the time of the April 21 attacks were both arrested for failing to act on available intelligence, which warned of pending attacks.2019 Terrorist Incidents: On Easter Sunday, Sri Lankan citizens who pledged allegiance to ISIS detonated backpack suicide bombs in four hotels and three churches in the greater Colombo area and Batticaloa, killing more than 260 people, including five Americans.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Government of Sri Lanka continued to use the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), enacted in 1979 as a wartime measure, which gives the police broad powers to search, arrest, and detain individuals.  After the Easter attacks, the government issued a four-month state of emergency, which also gave search, detain, and arrest powers to the military.  More than 1,000 individuals were arrested under the PTA in wake of the attacks, although just more than 100 remained in custody at year’s end.  A draft Counter Terrorism Act (CTA) set to repeal and replace the PTA remained under debate in parliament at year’s end.  According to international and domestic legal experts, the CTA would clarify the definition and punishment for terrorist activities and provide a current schedule of designated terrorist organizations.  The first version of the schedule designated three domestic terrorist organizations, all of which had been connected to the Easter attacks.  In August, parliament passed the “Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Act, No. 24 of 2018 (MACMA),” which made a number of improvements to Sri Lanka’s processing of mutual legal assistance requests, which could help in prosecuting terrorism cases.The Special Task Force is a paramilitary unit of the Sri Lanka Police specializing in CT and counterinsurgency operations and charged with ensuring security of top government and foreign government officials, protecting sensitive targets, and suppressing activities that pose a threat to national security.  Within the regular police structure, there is a Counter-Terrorism Investigation Division, which was moved under the Criminal Investigation Division in May.  The police remained under the Ministry of Defense at year’s end.  The Easter attacks highlighted gaps in information sharing among Sri Lanka’s security sector agencies.  Reforms to address these issues were underway at year’s end.  Sri Lanka Police cooperated extensively with the FBI on the investigation into the Easter attacks.  All suspects related to these attacks are currently in custody.  Indictments for these attacks were pending at year’s end.Sri Lanka’s border and maritime security remained vulnerable.  The government is working with the UN, along with Japan, to enhance border management systems at Colombo’s international airport.  The Sri Lankan government also expanded its partnership with the United States to secure its maritime border.  The U.S. Coast Guard, under the Department of State’s EXBS (Export Control and Related Border Security) program, continued to train Sri Lankan Coast Guard and Navy personnel on maritime law enforcement and security operation, and the Government of Sri Lanka continued to cooperate with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Energy through the container security initiative, “Megaports Initiative.”  The U.S. Department of Defense continues regular engagements with the Sri Lankan Navy Special Boat Squadron and Fast Attack Flotilla to enhance maritime security through the expansion of vessel board, search, and seizure capabilities.Sri Lanka concluded two major trials of terrorist attacks from the LTTE period.  On January 10, the North Central Provincial High Court sentenced two former LTTE members to 185 years’ rigorous imprisonment for shooting down a Sri Lankan Air Force plane in March 2000, which killed 37 people.  On January 23, the Anuradhapura High Court sentenced two former LTTE members to 25 years’ rigorous imprisonment for the murder of eight people, including an Army officer, in 2007.  Throughout the year, police arrested several people who are alleged to have had ties to the LTTE for possession of weapons and ammunition.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Sri Lanka belongs to APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Sri Lanka’s FIU is a member of the Egmont Group.  In October, FATF removed Sri Lanka from its grey list after Sri Lanka completed an action plan to address the strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT system.Countering Violent Extremism:  Following the April attacks, the Sri Lankan government established a new office under the Ministry of Defense to create new CVE policies to counter violent extremism.  Discussions of education reforms and other measures were underway at year’s end.International and Regional Cooperation:  Sri Lanka has actively sought assistance on CT issues from the United Nations after the attacks, as well as from key donor countries.  The EU, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and India have all pledged CT assistance – with India offering $50 million to the newly-elected Rajapaksa administration.  Sri Lanka is a partner nation in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.The Tajik government continues to make efforts to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism, enhance border security, and detect terrorist financing.  The government maintains that northern Afghanistan is a primary source of terrorist activity, and Tajik security officials allege that thousands of militants, including FTFs, are present in Afghanistan’s northern provinces.  The Tajik government reported on May 19 that prison guards and inmates were killed in a riot that broke out at the Kirpichniy high-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Dushanbe.  On November 6, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack on a remote border post along the Tajik-Uzbek border.  The Tajik government cooperates with international organizations, such as the EU, the OSCE, and UN on combating terrorism.  Tajikistan is willing to engage with the United States on CT and border security issues.2019 Terrorist Incidents: On May 19 the Tajik government reported that three prison guards and 29 inmates were killed in a riot that broke out at the Kirpichniy high-security correctional facility in Vahdat on the outskirts of Dushanbe.  Tajik authorities blamed the uprising on inmates serving time for alleged ties to terrorist or “extremist” groups.  The Tajik Ministry of Interior Affairs also claimed that the ringleader of the riot was Behruz Gulmurod, the son of Gulmurod Halimov, the former Tajik special forces commander who defected to ISIS in 2015. ISIS claimed responsibility for the riot, as well as the release of prisoners affiliated with the Islamic State.On November 6, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack on a remote border post along the Tajik-Uzbek border that Tajik authorities claim killed at least 17 people.  The State Committee for National Security (GKNB) affirmed that the attackers were ISIS loyalists and that the attack occurred near the small town of Esanboi, in Tajikistan’s southwest Rudaki region.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Tajikistan’s lower house of Parliament ratified an agreement in October that authorized border agencies of Commonwealth of Independent States to assist with rapid response to external border threats.  OSCE’s Transnational Threats Department convened a CT seminar in Dushanbe that provided Tajik law enforcement officials with a platform to share best practices for criminal justice responses for combatting terrorism.  Tajikistan repatriated 84 children of FTFs using its own resources in April.  The Tajik government continues to unilaterally designate political opposition groups such as the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, or religious affiliations, such as Salafi Muslims, as terrorist groups.Travel document security and biographic and biometric screening capabilities are still lacking at ports of entry, particularly at land crossings.  Major entry points have access to INTERPOL data and other lists, but connectivity issues at smaller border posts remain unresolved.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Tajikistan is a member of the EAG.  Tajikistan’s FIU is also a member of the Egmont Group.In January, the EAG published a Mutual Evaluation Report that reviewed Tajikistan’s compliance with FATF standards and the effectiveness of Tajikistan’s AML/CFT system.  In May, Tajikistan hosted the second annual high-level conference dedicated to addressing regional terrorism trends, “International and Regional Cooperation on Countering Terrorism and its Financing through Illicit Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime.”  High-ranking delegates from former Soviet bloc countries, Afghanistan, Japan, the United States, and multilateral organizations including the UN, the OSCE, and CSTO member states participated.On December 1, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) announced that it will launch a national money transfer center that will centralize the receipt of remittances from abroad.  The NBT will be able to monitor and regulate alternative remittances services, collect data on wire transfers, and monitor non-profit organizations to prevent misuse of financing to sponsor terrorist activities.Countering Violent Extremism:  Tajikistan amended its criminal laws in 2015, allowing authorities to pardon Tajik FTFs who voluntarily return home from Iraq or Syria, express remorse for their actions, and renounce ties to foreign militant groups.  The Tajik government continues to place heavy restrictions on groups it classifies as “extremist,” including those groups’ political and religious expression.  In 2019, Tajikistan was again designated a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.International and Regional Cooperation:  Tajikistan is a strong supporter of the C5+1 framework in the region and serves as a co-chair of the C5+1 Security Working Group.  In May, Tajikistan hosted the most recent Security Working Group, with the participation of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP), where participants discussed efforts to repatriate, rehabilitate, and reintegrate FTFs.The Tajik government coordinated with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to prepare for the potential influx of Afghan refugees and/or civil unrest in Afghanistan.  Twenty-eight government agencies participated in the June exercise to prepare a government response to the potential influx of Afghan refugees in case of widespread unrest in northern Afghanistan.The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China arrived in Badakhshon’s Ishkashim district for joint Tajik-Chinese anti-terrorism exercises in August.  The joint exercises took place along the border with Afghanistan and involved one PLA company and a Tajik mobile forces battalion.  The two militaries trained against terrorist infiltration from Afghanistan into China via Tajik territory.Tajikistan also participated in UNODC-administered training on detecting and preventing terrorist travel to enhance compliance with UNSCR 2396.  Tajikistan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.  During the 2019 CIS Summit, Tajikistan’s president signed onto a cooperative agreement between the CIS members to jointly combat terrorism.  The agreement included preventive measures for “countering extremism, radicalization of the population,” and financing terrorism, as well as involving civil society and mass media, holding special trainings, and the use of modern technologies for timely response to potential threats.The Government of Turkmenistan continued its efforts to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism, ensure border security, and detect terrorist financing.  The government continued to cooperate with international organizations and participated in the C5+1 regional framework to counter international terrorism.  Turkmen authorities continued to maintain close surveillance on its population and borders.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Turkmenistan in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no reported changes in 2019.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Turkmenistan belongs to the EAG, and the government continued to express interest in gaining admission to the Egmont Group.  During 2019, the Government of Turkmenistan cooperated with and attended trainings offered by international organizations such as the UN and the OSCE on responding to CT threats, combating money laundering, and other CFT issues.  The Turkmen government continued to monitor and regulate alternative remittance services, collected data on wire transfers, and monitored non-profit organizations, purportedly to prevent misuse of financing to sponsor terrorist activities.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, the Government of Turkmenistan cooperated with international organizations and participated in the C5+1 regional CVE framework. Turkmen government officials also participated in the C5+1 regional framework, held in August in Nur-Sultan and September in New York, to counter international terrorism.  Officials also participated in a C5+1 regional workshop in Tajikistan in May, with the participation of USIP, and met with CVE experts from USIP in Ashgabat in July.International and Regional Cooperation:  Turkmenistan continued to cooperate with international and regional organizations such as the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, the UN Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, the UNODC, the UN Counter-Terrorism Center, the EU, the OSCE, and others.In May 2019, a delegation from Turkmenistan met with CTED leadership during the High-Level Conference on International and Regional Cooperation on Countering Terrorism in Dushanbe.  During the Commonwealth of Independent States summit in Ashgabat on October 11, the heads of state adopted and signed a Program of Cooperation among the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the Fight against Terrorism and Other Violent Extremism for 2020-2022.Consultations of CIS countries on combatting terrorism were held in Ashgabat on November 14.  Participants discussed widening collective actions on combatting terrorism, the role of the UN in combatting terrorism and its financial backing, and rendering the required legal assistance among the CIS partners.  The parties also discussed preventive measures for “countering extremism, radicalization of the population,” and financing terrorism.  They also addressed the necessity of involving civil society and mass media, holding special trainings, and the use of modern technologies for timely response to potential threats.As a member of the C5+1 diplomatic platform, Turkmenistan participates in the associated Security Working Group, which focuses on regional CT cooperation.The Government of Uzbekistan remained concerned about the potential spillover of terrorism from Afghanistan and its Central Asian neighbors, the return of ISIS fighters from Iraq and Syria, and terrorist radicalization of Uzbekistanis abroad.  The government has actively worked to improve its implementation of existing laws, including the development of a comprehensive national CT strategy and action plan, but there were no changes to the legislative framework in 2019.  Uzbekistan continued to improve relations with its neighbors in many areas, including security cooperation.  Uzbekistan remains an active participant in the C5+1 diplomatic platform, which supports CVE programming.  Uzbekistan also signed a bilateral agreement with India on CT cooperation and a separate agreement with CIS states in 2019.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Uzbekistan in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no significant changes to terrorism-related legislation and law enforcement practices in 2019.  The Law on Combating Terrorism governs terrorism-related investigations and prosecutions and identifies the State Security Service (SSS) as the lead CT law enforcement agency.  The SSS and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) have dedicated CT units.  Uzbekistan also criminalizes terrorism under its criminal code, and the National Development Strategy for 2017-2021 targets corruption, “extremism,” and terrorism.The government reported an additional removal of 402 people from its watchlist of alleged “extremists” in 2019.  The government facilitated the return of 156 individuals mostly women and children from Iraq and Syria and continued to explore options on the potential repatriation of FTFs from Syria throughout 2019.Uzbek law enforcement maintains its own terrorist watchlist and contributes to INTERPOL databases.  Most border posts and airports are equipped with biometric data scanners.  Uzbekistan has mostly completed the conversion of all passports to a new biometric version and has introduced international biometric passports for travel abroad.Uzbekistan has not reported specific actions to implement UNSCRs 2309 and 2396.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Uzbekistan belongs to the EAG.  There were no updates in the passage or implementation of laws pertaining to CFT in 2019.  Government officials received INL-funded training in 2019 that will support the ability to conduct financial investigations, improve interagency coordination on AML/CFT, and prepare for the upcoming EAG assessment of Uzbekistan’s compliance with international FATF standards.  In addition, the Commission on Combatting Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, headed by the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) is preparing a new resolution to introduce joint financial investigations by MIA, SSS, PGO, and FIU.Countering Violent Extremism:  Uzbekistan remains concerned about the terrorist radicalization of Uzbekistanis, particularly labor migrants in Russia and other countries.  Local government organizations continued to educate citizens about the dangers of “religious extremism.”  The government has developed advertisements and funded other projects specifically targeting migrants deemed to be at high risk of terrorist radicalization.  Official media and Tashkent Islamic University produced public messages about the dangers of terrorism and posted them on social media platforms and messaging apps.The Government of Uzbekistan has publicly endorsed rehabilitation and reintegration of citizens previously engaged or suspected of being engaged in terrorist activities.  In 2019, the government repatriated 220 FTF family members from Iraq and Syria, mostly women and children.  The government has worked to reintegrate them into their home communities and has expeditiously identified suitable family for unaccompanied minors or placed them in orphanages.  In close cooperation with UNICEF, the government has provided a mix of national and local-level social services to help reintegrate the returnees and has continuously monitored their progress.In 2019, with support from the OSCE, an interagency working group coordinated by the Uzbekistani National Security Council developed a national strategy on “preventing and countering violent extremism and terrorism.”  That working group participated in a State Department-funded trip to the United States in late 2019 as part of a plan to finalize the strategy and action plan. Formal adoption of the strategy is expected in early 2020.  The government also participated in the Central Asia + United States (C5+1) regional CVE framework.  This included the hosting of a C5+1 regional workshop on CVE in May in Tashkent and a separate event in Samarkand in November focused on FTF reintegration and rehabilitation.International and Regional Cooperation:  Uzbekistan is a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  In 2019, Uzbekistan continued its participation in the UN Counter Terrorism Committee and the OSCE Action against Terrorism Unit.  During the 2019 CIS Summit, Uzbekistan became a signatory to a cooperative agreement between CIS members to jointly combat terrorism.  The agreement included preventive measures for “countering extremism, radicalization of the population,” financing terrorism, as well as involving civil society and mass media, holding special trainings, and the use of modern technologies for timely response to potential threats.  In addition, Uzbekistan has sought bilateral agreements with other countries related to CT issues and signed an agreement with India in November on enhanced CT cooperation.In 2019, Uzbekistan continued its active engagement in the C5+1 diplomatic platform and its associated C5+1 Security Working Group, which focuses on regional CT cooperation and participated in a Strong Cities regional workshop in Almaty in December that focused on reintegration and rehabilitation of FTFs and their families.  Uzbekistan also participated in UNODC-administered training on detecting and preventing terrorist travel to enhance compliance with UNSCR 2396.')"

    "complete_WE_text = ('In 2019, the Lebanon-based and Iran-backed terrorist group Hizballah continued its long history of activity in the Western Hemisphere, including its use of supporters and financiers who operate in the Tri-Border Area (TBA) of South America, where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet.  The United States continues to be vigilant about individuals affiliated with international terrorist groups, including al-Qa’ida and ISIS, who have made attempts to exploit the region.  These include a suspected AQ operative in Brazil, about whom the FBI issued a public notice in August, as well as ISIS supporters and sympathizers in a number of countries including Canada and Trinidad and Tobago.  Meanwhile, regional terrorist groups, such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) and Shining Path, were active in the hemisphere, including in Colombia, Venezuela, and Peru.  In Colombia, an estimated 2,600 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) dissidents who never demobilized, left the peace process, or are new recruits, continued violent attacks, primarily to enable narcotics trafficking and other criminal activities.  While travel of FTFs from the Western Hemisphere to conflict zones was limited in 2019, the potential return of these battle-tested terrorists remained a concern.Many Latin American countries have porous borders, limited law enforcement capabilities, and established smuggling routes.  Commercial hubs in the TBA and Panama remained regional nodes for money laundering and vulnerable to terrorist financing.  Corruption, weak government institutions, insufficient interagency cooperation, weak or non-existent legislation, and a general lack of resources likewise remained obstacles to improving security.  Nevertheless, some Western Hemisphere countries made significant progress in their counterterrorism efforts in 2019 and strengthened regional cooperation against terrorism.Cuba and Venezuela continued to provide permissive environments for terrorists.  In Venezuela, individuals linked to FARC dissidents (who remain committed to terrorism notwithstanding the peace accord) and the ELN, as well as Hizballah sympathizers, were present in the country.  Nicolas Maduro has openly welcomed former FARC leaders who announced a return to terrorist activities.  Members of the ELN who were in Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government since 2017 also remained in Cuba.  Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombia’s request to extradite 10 ELN leaders after that group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy, which killed 22 and injured 87 others.  Multiple fugitives who committed or supported acts of terrorism in the United States also continued to live freely in Cuba.Several countries in the region took steps in 2019 to designate Hizballah as a terrorist organization.  Argentina developed a new sanctions regime and used it to designate the entirety of Hizballah and individuals specifically connected to the 1992 and 1994 bombings of the Israeli Embassy and Argentine Israelite Mutual Association Jewish community center in Buenos Aires.  Paraguay designated terrorist organizations and individuals, in particular targeting Hizballah, and is identifying possible sanctions against designated entities.  In October, Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly designated Hizballah as a terrorist organization, along with other groups including ISIS and ELN.  In Peru, the government continued efforts to retry Hizballah operative Muhammad Ghaleb Hamdar after a Peruvian court previously acquitted him of terrorism charges in 2017.Argentina hosted the Second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in July, which included 18 participating countries.  At the Ministerial, countries affirmed that ISIS, al-Qa’ida, and their affiliated organizations were a terrorist threat, expressed concern about Hizballah activities in the hemisphere, and recognized ELN as a threat to regional stability.  At the Ministerial, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States established the Regional Security Mechanism (RSM).  The RSM – a reconstituting of the previous “3+1” initiative – focuses on the threats of transnational crime and terrorism in the region.  In November 2019, the RSM held its first experts meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay, bringing together officials from intelligence, law enforcement, border security, financial intelligence, financial regulatory, and foreign affairs agencies from the four member countries.In October, the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (OAS/CICTE) formally announced the launch of the Inter-American Network on Counterterrorism, with funding support from Chile and the United States.  The network, the only one of its kind in the Americas, will operate on a 24/7 basis among OAS member states.  By facilitating communication among points of contact designated by each member state, countries of the Western Hemisphere will be able to respond more effectively to terrorist threats.During 2019, Argentina continued to focus its counterterrorism strategy on the Tri-Border Area (TBA) of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay where suspected terrorism financing networks operate.  Robust U.S.-Argentine law enforcement and security cooperation continued in 2019.  Argentina created a “Public Register of People and Entities Linked to Acts of Terrorism and their Financing,” which it used to designate Hizballah as a terrorist entity.  On July 19, Argentina hosted the Second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in Buenos Aires.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no reported terrorist incidents in Argentina during 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  On July 16, then-President Macri signed a presidential decree creating a “Public Register of People and Entities Linked to Acts of Terrorism and their Financing” and added Hizballah to the registry on July 17.  The registry, which is accessible to the public and controlled by the Ministry of Justice, derives its listings from UN designated terrorist groups, prosecutions for terrorism, and the Financial Information Unit (UIF).Plans to introduce changes to the criminal code to reform Argentina’s legal framework for terrorism cases remained delayed in 2019.  The executive branch drafted and submitted new legislation to Congress for approval in March 2019; however, it has not yet been approved.  In January 2019, then-President Macri issued a presidential decree creating an asset forfeiture regime enabling asset forfeiture in terrorism and terrorism financing cases without the need for a conviction.Multiple security agencies maintained specialized law enforcement units that have substantial capabilities to respond to criminal activities, including terrorist incidents.  Argentina continued to develop its nationwide network of law enforcement Intelligence Fusion Centers.  By deploying additional technology, personnel, and equipment, the Argentine Ministry of Security (MOS) improved its law enforcement capacity at high-risk ports of entry along its northern border.  The MOS and its federal security forces continue to incorporate biometric data into their fight against international terrorism and transnational crime.Argentina strengthened its intelligence and analysis activities through its participation in the Tripartite Command, an interagency security mechanism created by Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay to exchange information and combat transnational threats, including terrorism, in the TBA.The lack of justice for Hizballah’s 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) remained in the news and prompted a proposal to reform the criminal code by allowing trials in absentia.  In March, the Argentine Supreme Court rejected an appeal submitted by former Argentine President Fernandez de Kirchner to avoid oral trial for allegedly covering up Iran’s involvement in the AMIA attack by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Iran in 2013.  The Supreme Court ratified a pre-trial detention order against her; however, the Argentine Senate decided not to vote to remove her parliamentary immunity from arrest.  In December, the Argentine federal trial court hearing the case revoked the pre-trial detention order, finding that her investiture as vice president had removed the risk she could flee.Argentine prosecutors charged seven Iranians (and then-Iranian President Rafsanjani) in October 2006 as suspects in the AMIA bombing in what is now known as the “AMIA I” case, but the lead prosecutor died under suspicious circumstances, and the Iranian suspects have never been brought to justice.  A four-year trial seeking to determine local complicity in the deviation of the investigation, commonly known as the “AMIA II” case, concluded on February 28 with the acquittal of former Argentine President Carlos Menem, the convictions of former federal judge Juan José Galeano and then-intelligence chief Hugo Anzorreguy, and the acquittals and/or suspended sentences for the other 10 individuals accused.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Argentina is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT), a FATF-style regional body.  Its FIU, known as the Financial Information Unit Argentina (UIF), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Recent reforms have empowered the UIF to act as the lead agency on all financial intelligence matters.  The TBA is one of the principal routes into Argentina for multi-billion-dollar trade-based money laundering, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, and other smuggling operations.  In addition, many of the money laundering organizations in the TBA have known or suspected links to the terrorist organization Hizballah.In 2019, the UIF ordered the freezing of assets in the country belonging to Hizballah and its members after officially designating the group a terrorist organization.  The government also created a National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.In July 2019, the FIU enacted regulation for credit and debit card operators, prepaid cards, and other means of payment to implement a new risk-based approach in line with FATF recommendations.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  On July 19, Argentina hosted the Second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in Buenos Aires.  Argentina is a member of the RSM and participated in the first experts-level meeting of the RSM November 12-13 in Asuncion.  Argentina participated in the Organization of American States (OAS) Inter-American Committee against Terrorism and the Southern Common Market Special Forum on Terrorism.  The United States and Argentina co-hosted a U.S. DOJ-sponsored Practitioner’s Workshop August 1-2 in Iguazu on the Argentine side of the TBA.  The workshop included prosecutors, judges, law enforcement investigators, financial intelligence/sanctions officials, and intelligence officials from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States.Brazil and the United States maintained strong counterterrorism cooperation in 2019, building on collaborative efforts underway since the 2016 Summer Olympics.  The Brazilian Federal Police (PF), Brazil’s lead counterterrorism agency, worked closely with the United States and other nations’ law enforcement entities to assess and mitigate potential terrorist threats.  The Brazilian government continued to support CT activities, which included third-country technical assistance for controlling sensitive technologies and investigating fraudulent travel documents.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist attacks reported in Brazil in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no major changes to counterterrorism legislation in 2019.In January, President Jair Bolsonaro combined the Ministries of Justice and of Public Security, with PF under the authority of the new super ministry.In August, Brazil promulgated into law the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, to which it became a signatory on September 14, 2005.The FBI, in coordination with PF, issued a notice in August seeking information about Mohamed Ahmed Elsayed Ahmed Ibrahim, an Egyptian suspected al-Qa’ida operative and facilitator living in Brazil.  The public notice – the first of its kind for the region – stated that Ibrahim was being sought for questioning for his alleged involvement in plotting attacks against the United States and its interests.  The investigation is ongoing.There were no new arrests or convictions related to 2016’s Operation Hashtag, which dismantled a loose, online, pro-ISIS network prior to the 2016 Olympics, or Operation Atila, which began in 2017 to investigate the use of mobile communication applications to promote terrorist groups.  There were no new arrests or convictions under Operation Bravata, launched by PF in 2018 to combat racist and terrorist threats made online.Brazilian authorities continued to work with other concerned nations – particularly the United States – to counter document fraud.  Regional and international joint operations successfully disrupted numerous document vendors and facilitators, as well as related human smuggling networks.During President Bolsonaro’s March visit to Washington, DC, PF agreed to send its first permanent liaison officer to CBP’s National Targeting Center to exchange real-time information on persons of interest traveling through Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos International Airport (GRU) – the busiest airport in South America.  CBP continued the pilot phase of the Joint Security Program (JSP) in GRU with the goal of identifying high-risk air travelers and contraband arriving to and departing from Brazil.  JSP officers work side-by-side with Brazilian law enforcement and border control counterparts to identify travelers with links to terrorism and narcotics, weapons, currency, or alien smuggling.  Due to fiscal restraints, the PF has yet to assign full-time, permanent staff to the JSP.In March, the Brazilian Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the FBI completed an information sharing arrangement that creates a framework for Brazil to adopt a U.S.-standard biometrics collection system.  The joint biometrics program’s focus is to counter identity fraud-based travel in GRU and in the TBA of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Brazil is a member of the FATF and GAFILAT.  Its FIU, the Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Brazil made progress mitigating the shortcomings identified in its third-round FATF mutual evaluation report from 2010, and it continued to address the remaining deficiencies ahead of its mutual evaluation scheduled for 2021.In February, Brazil’s Congress passed a Countering Financing of Terrorism bill, which President Bolsonaro signed into law in June.  The law enables Brazilian authorities to designate terrorists and terrorism financiers domestically and allows for the immediate freezing of assets of terrorism financiers designated domestically, as well as under UN Security Council resolutions.  The law also updates legislation used to combat criminals and corporations engaged in money laundering, bringing Brazil’s legislative framework more in line with international standards.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Brazilian Congress and various government agencies, including PF and Ministry of Foreign Relations, organized or participated in conferences addressing international terrorism, with a particular emphasis on countering “online radicalization and preventing the use of the internet for terrorist purposes.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Brazil participated in regional counterterrorism fora, including the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism, and the Southern Common Market’s working group on terrorism and sub-working group on financial issues.  Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay coordinated law enforcement efforts in the TBA by means of their Trilateral Tri-Border Area Command.Canada remains one of the strongest and most able U.S. partners in the global fight against terrorism, and CT cooperation with Canada is excellent.  Prosecutors continued to face challenges in bringing to trial cases underpinned by battlefield evidence.  Canada generally declined to repatriate FTFs or family members from Syria and Iraq.  The government took the position that it had no legal obligation to facilitate their return to Canada, including those in the custody of Syrian Democratic Forces, but acknowledged a Canadian Charter right to return if the individuals approached Canadian territory.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Bill C-59 received royal assent in June 2019.  Among other provisions, the bill permits active cyber operations, strengthens the Canadian Security Intelligence Services’ ability to disrupt terrorist plots, and revises the criminal offense of counseling terrorism.Canada listed a number of terrorist organizations in 2019.  On February 11, Canada listed Harakat Sawa’d Misr (HASM) as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code and renewed the existing 60 entities on the list following the required two-year review.  On June 21, the Al-Ashtar Brigades was listed as a terrorist entity in the Criminal Code.  On June 26, Canada designated the REMT group Blood & Honor and its armed branch Combat 18 as terrorist organizations.  On April 23, Canada added three Sikh-Canadian activists to its no-fly list.  Two individuals, Bhagat Singh Brar and Parvkar Singh Dulai, have filed legal challenges.Canada opened some new terrorism prosecutions while others remain ongoing:In January, Hussam Eddin Alzahabi and a minor were arrested in Kingston, Ontario, and the minor was charged with terrorism-related offenses including knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity, counseling a person to use an explosive or other lethal device in a public place with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, uttering a threat, and “making or having in his possession or under his care of control an explosive substance” designed to endanger life “or cause serious damage to property.” The minor appeared in court on April 23 and has been detained since then.In January and February, Rehab Dughmosh was convicted of four offenses related to an attempt to aid ISIS (two counts of assault with a weapon, one count of carrying a weapon, and one count of leaving Canada for the purpose of committing a criminal offense) and sentenced to seven years in prison for attacking workers at a Canadian Tire store on June 3, 2017. She also attempted to travel to Syria in April 2016.On February 8, Alexandre Bissonnette was sentenced to 40 years in prison without the possibility of parole for the January 29, 2017, attack on the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec. The Crown appealed the sentencing on March 12, seeking 50 years in prison with parole only possible after 25 years.On February 28, Pamir Hakimzadeh was sentenced to four years for one count of leaving Canada (in September 2014) to participate in a terrorist activity. On June 28, he was released after completing his sentence and the judge found Hakimzadeh had not continued to voice extremist views.On August 27, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered a new trial for VIA Rail terror offenders Raed Jaser and Chiheb Esseghaier based on improper jury selection. The offenders chose trial by judge alone, to commence on September 14, 2020.  The Crown appealed the decision on November 19.On October 16, Awso Peshdary’s lawyers filed a charter challenge seeking a stay of proceedings in his long-running terror trial, alleging government secrecy around evidence destruction.On October 24, Abdullahi Ahmed Abdullahi was extradited to the United States to face charges of conspiring to provide and providing material support to ISIS recruits.On November 29, the Quebec Court of Appeal rejected an appeal from Ismael Habib, who is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence for attempting to join ISIS in Syria in 2013.On December 6, Ikar Mao was arrested in Ontario and charged with participating in the activities of a terrorist group and leaving Canada to take part in a terrorist activity. Mao earlier had faced terrorism charges in Turkey prior to his return to Canada in October.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Canada is a member of the FATF and the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), a FATF-style regional body.  Its FIU, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC – CANAFE), is a member of the Egmont Group.Canada’s Budget 2019 included an integrated plan to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including strengthening the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s operational and investigative capacity, as well as strengthening FINTRAC’s operational capacity to increase compliance examinations and enforcement in the real estate sector.Countering Violent Extremism:  Canada has announced several new initiatives and funding:On February 7, Canada announced the launch of the National Expert Committee on Countering Radicalization to Violence. It will advance the work of the Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence and further the National Strategy on Countering Radicalization to Violence.On February 11, Canada announced $1.33 million over five years to the John Howard Society of Ottawa to pilot the Project ReSet program, designed to provide at-risk persons with individualized intervention plans.On March 6, Canada announced a grant of $279,329 over three years to the University of Ontario Institute of Technology to study REMT, which Canada sometimes refers to as “ideologically motivated violent extremism,” and to conduct analysis of online content and media coverage.On March 27, the Canada Centre concluded a week of events to further Canada’s National Strategy on Countering Radicalization to Violence.On June 26, Canada announced a contribution of up to $761,145 to Tech Against Terrorism for the creation of a digital repository to assist smaller companies to detect and remove online terrorist content. Canada also will convene a Youth Summit on Countering Violent Extremism Online to learn about online threats and develop effective tools to combat them.On August 21, Canada announced $231,580 over three years to the Centre of Expertise and Training on Religious Fundamentalism, Political Ideologies, and Radicalization for research on what it terms “far-right extremism.”International and Regional Cooperation:  Canada became co-chair (with Morocco) of the Global Counterterrorism Forum in September 2019 for a two-year term.  Canada played a major role in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2019 and has been a leading contributor to the Coalition’s military support and humanitarian assistance.  Canadian Special Forces in Iraq work with local counterparts to defeat ISIS.  Canada also leads the non-combat NATO Mission in Iraq.The National Liberation Army (ELN) has seen a resurgence and in some areas of Colombia is filling the void left by FARC ex-combatants who left the battlefield.  Colombian authorities estimate there are around 3,000 active members of the ELN, 1,400 of whom the government claims are camped across the border in Venezuela.  Colombian authorities state publicly there are 36 ELN camps strategically located on the Venezuela side of the Colombia-Venezuela border.  As of December 2019, roughly 13,000 FARC ex-combatants (including former rank-and-file guerrillas and militia) continue to participate in the reintegration process based on the 2016 peace accord.  Ongoing challenges to peace accord implementation and continued security vacuums have created risk for terrorist activity and attacks on civilians, security forces, and infrastructure in some areas in 2019.  An estimated 2,600 FARC dissidents who never demobilized, left the peace process, or are new recruits, continued violent attacks, primarily to enable narcotics trafficking and other criminal activities, particularly in border regions and areas previously controlled by the former FARC.Colombian-U.S. CT cooperation remains strong.  Colombia has openly condemned ISIS and its objectives.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  In 2019, FARC dissidents and the ELN continued to commit crimes and acts of terror throughout the country – including bombings, violence against civilian populations, and violent attacks against military and police facilities.In January, an ELN terrorist detonated a car bomb inside Colombia’s national police academy in Bogota, killing 22 cadets and injuring 87.Through the end of December, IEDs suspected to have been placed by groups such as FARC dissidents, ELN members, and others have killed 10 and wounded 56 police officers, military members, and civilians participating in manual coca eradication operations.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no changes to terrorism-related legislation and investigation procedures in 2019.Colombian border security remained an area of vulnerability as law enforcement officers continued to face the challenge of working in areas with porous borders, difficult topography, illegal armed groups, and drug trafficking.The U.S. and Colombian governments signed the first of two arrangements to exchange terrorist screening data in December 2019, with an aim to detect and prevent terrorist travel in line with UNSCR 2396 obligations.In August 2019, U.S. Department of Justice representatives at U.S. Embassy Bogota coordinated a U.S.-Colombia Bilateral ELN Case Development Coordination Conference.  The conference brought together 60 U.S. law enforcement agents and prosecutors from across the United States and their Colombian counterparts to facilitate ELN case development in the United States by harmonizing evidence collection procedures with Colombian legal standards.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Colombia is a member of GAFILAT.  Its FIU, the Unidad de Informacion y Analisis Financiero is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  In 2019, roughly 13,000 FARC ex-combatants and former militia members who demobilized under the 2016 peace accord continued to participate in social and economic reincorporation activities.  Colombia continued to employ a modern, multi-agency approach to CVE, with a focus on encouraging individual guerrillas (primarily the ELN) to demobilize.  The number of members of armed groups who demobilized individually declined from 635 in 2018 to 414 in 2019.  Of the 414 members, 161 were minors.International and Regional Cooperation:  Colombia is a founding member of the Global Counter Terrorism Forum and continues to lead in providing security training and assistance to other countries in the region.  In 2019, Colombia proposed hosting the Third Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in January 2020.  Throughout 2019, Colombia laid the groundwork for declaring Hizballah a terrorist organization and commenced an interagency process to formalize prohibitions against support for Hizballah, as well as necessary legislation and regulations to implement the decision.Cuba was designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1982 because of its long history of providing advice, safe haven, communications, training, and financial support to guerrilla groups and individual terrorists.  This designation was rescinded in 2015.  Cuba maintains close and collaborative ties with designated state sponsors of terror such as Iran and North Korea.  The Cuban regime continues to host ELN leaders associated with now-defunct peace talks to reside in Cuba, despite Colombia’s repeated requests for their extradition.  Cuba also continues to harbor multiple fugitives who committed or supported acts of terrorism in the United States.  The U.S. Department of State certified Cuba as “not cooperating fully” with U.S. counterterrorism efforts for 2019, the first such certification of Cuba since 2015.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist attacks in Cuba in 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Citing peace negotiation protocols, Cuba refused Colombia’s request to extradite 10 ELN leaders living in Havana after that group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy that killed 22 people and injured 87 others.  On October 11, Colombia filed extradition requests for ELN leaders Victor Orlando Cubides (aka “Pablo Tejada”) and Isreal Ramirez Pineda (aka “Pablo Beltran”) with the Cuban government, which has pointedly not responded.  Though Cuba’s government denies allowing ELN members to plan terrorist attacks from its territory, fugitive ELN terrorists continue to live in Havana, shielded by the Cuban regime, while ELN members continue to attack, kidnap, and murder in Colombia.In addition to ELN terrorists, there was credible reporting that FARC dissidents who abandoned the peace process in Colombia traveled to Havana to seek the regime’s support.  On July 28 during the closing remarks of the Sao Paolo Forum in Caracas, Nicolas Maduro stated that Iván Márquez and Jesús Santrich – former FARC leaders who fled Colombia after abandoning the peace process and announced a return to terrorist activities – were both welcome in Venezuela.  Cuba is a key supporter of Maduro’s narco-regime and is an active participant in maintaining Maduro’s authority.Cuba also harbors several U.S. fugitives from justice wanted on charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades.  For example, the Cuban regime has refused to return Joanne Chesimard, aka Assata Shakur, a fugitive on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists List, who was convicted of executing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.  Cuba also has refused to return William “Guillermo” Morales, a fugitive bomb maker for the Armed Forces for National Liberation (FALN), who is wanted by the FBI and escaped detention after being convicted of charges related to domestic terrorism; Ishmael LaBeet, aka Ishmael Muslim Ali, who received eight life sentences after being convicted of killing eight people in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1972 and hijacking a plane to flee to Cuba in 1984; Charles Lee Hill, who has been charged with killing New Mexico state policeman Robert Rosenbloom in 1971; and Ambrose Henry Montfort, who used a bomb threat to hijack a passenger aircraft and fly to Cuba in 1983.  Cuba is also believed to host or have hosted U.S. fugitive terrorists Catherine Marie Kerkow and Elizabeth Anna Duke.  The Cuban government provides housing, food ration books, and medical care for all of the fugitives residing there.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Cuba is a member of the GAFILAT.  Its FIU, the Dirección General de Investigación de Operaciones Financieras, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  Cuba conducted no CVE efforts in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Cuba is an inactive member of the OAS and is not a member of NATO or the OSCE.Counterterrorism cooperation between Mexico and the United States remained strong. In 2011, the Mexican government aided U.S. efforts to disrupt an Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States. An operative, who planned to contact a Mexican criminal organization on behalf of elements of the Iranian government, was sentenced in 2013 in a federal court in New York City to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty for his role in the plot. In 2019, there was no credible evidence indicating international terrorist groups established bases in Mexico, worked directly with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States.  International supporters and facilitators of terrorist groups such as Hizballah, al-Qa’ida, and ISIS are active elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere, and the U.S. southern border remains vulnerable to potential terrorist transit.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  A Mexican ecological extremist movement called Individualistas Tendiendo a lo Salvaje, or Individualists Tending to the Wild, placed five rudimentary timed explosive devices constructed from pyrotechnics and pipes at commercial centers, including a shopping center, a Walmart, and a movie theater, in separate incidents in the State of Mexico between December 2018 and May 2019.  At least one device detonated (at the theater) and injured a theater employee.  Mexican law enforcement has not identified any suspects, nor made any arrests.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  In July, Mexico’s Congress passed an asset forfeiture bill; there were no additional changes to Mexico’s counterterrorism legislation in 2019.  The government lacked adequate laws prohibiting material support to terrorists and relied on counterterrorism regimes in other countries to thwart potential threats.The Center for National Intelligence (CNI), housed within the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection, was the lead agency for detecting, deterring, and preventing terrorist threats during 2019.  The Mexican Prosecutor General’s Office (FGR) was the lead agency for investigating and prosecuting terrorism-related offenses.  In 2019, FGR underwent a transition to reorganize, professionalize, and develop interdisciplinary investigation teams based on 2018 legislation.  Impunity remained a problem with extremely low rates of prosecution for all crimes.Mexico made significant efforts to strengthen its border controls and screen more individuals who entered its territory in 2019, deploying 27,000 military and security forces to enforce migration laws.  While unauthorized migration has decreased, an illicit flow of people and goods continued to transit Mexico’s southern border, and corruption still plagued Mexican ports of entry.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Mexico is a member of FATF and GAFILAT.  Mexico is also a cooperating and supporting nation of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) and is an observer of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures, two other FATF-style regional bodies.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit-Mexico, is a member of the Egmont Group.In July, the Mexican Congress passed a sweeping asset forfeiture bill that provides Mexican prosecutors with stronger tools to seize assets of illicit origin and those used to commit crimes in a process separate from any related criminal matter.  The legislation incorporated many best practices from Latin American countries and the UN’s asset forfeiture model.  Congress also passed two laws obliging currency exchange outlets and stockbrokers to avoid using funds that could finance terrorism.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes in 2019.  Mexico lacks official policies, initiatives, or programs to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment.International and Regional Cooperation:  On the margins of the UN General Assembly, Mexico issued a joint declaration with its MIKTA partners (Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and Australia) condemning “terrorism and violent extremism” and “expressing grave concern for the use of the internet for these purposes, including the incitement to discrimination and violence motivated by hate, racism, xenophobia and religious intolerance.” As part of its membership in the UN Human Rights Council, Mexico presented and led adoption of a resolution promoting respect for human rights and victims of terrorism while countering terrorism.  Mexico is an active member of the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism.  In the wake of the August 3 terrorist attack in El Paso, Texas, that resulted in the deaths of Mexican citizens, the Mexican Foreign Ministry pledged to lead a regional effort to combat white supremacist terrorism.Throughout 2019, Panama remained a willing partner for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in countering terrorism.  As a transit country for illicit goods, money, and migrants, Panama’s geographic location makes its willingness to engage on counterterrorism important for regional security.  In 2019, Panama held national elections, resulting in a near full turnover of key government offices in July 2019.  Under the new leadership of President Laurentino “Nito” Cortizo, the Panamanian government continued to cooperate on counterterrorism.Principal areas of CT cooperation with the United States were maritime sanctions and migration.  The Panamanian government de-flagged approximately 60 ships engaging in sanctions-violating actions, in support of U.S. sanctions.  Through the joint Special Interest Alien (SIA) Joint Task Force, a bilateral mechanism to share information on SIAs and KSTs and detain and/or deport them as needed, the Panamanian government cooperated with U.S. authorities on several CT-related cases this year.  Panama agreed to an Action Plan to address its grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) with concrete measures to be completed in stages by May 2020 and September 2020.Panama remained the first and only Latin American member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition and continues to be involved in the Coalition’s Counter-Terrorism Finance Working Group.  The Government of Panama participated in the November 2019 working group meeting in Luxembourg.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no incidents related to international terrorism in Panama during 2019.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Panama does not have comprehensive counterterrorism legislation or a robust counterterrorism legal framework.  While the country does not have a formal coordinating authority below the cabinet level, officials from the National Security Council, the National Border Service (SENAFRONT), the National Migration Service (SNM), and National Police (PNP) met frequently internally and with U.S. government officialsto efficiently coordinate and act on migration alerts, resulting in the detention and deportation of travelers who represented a security risk.  Consistent with UNSCR 2396 obligations, Panama collected biographic and biometric data, shared terrorism identity information with regional partners, collected and analyzed API and PNR, and participated in INTERPOL.The SIA Joint Task Force cooperated with U.S. authorities on several CT-related cases.  The Task Force includes assignees from PNP, SENAFRONT, National Air and Naval Service, SNM, and Panama’s intelligence service (Consejo), as well as the U.S. Embassy’s DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection teams.  Since its creation in the previous year, the Panamanian government has provided physical space for the Task Force to operate, and the Task Force has supported several CT-related investigations.While Panama’s own intelligence collection capacity is limited, the Panamanian government acted as a willing partner in responding to U.S. requests.  Logistical challenges, such as routing flights for deportations and a lack of diplomatic relationships with some migrants’ countries of origin, continue to limit the Government of Panama’s ability to deport.  The Cortizo government signaled a willingness to increase deportations but requested U.S. government assistance to do so.The Ministry of Security and the National Customs Authority solicited bids to address the country’s lack of cargo scanners.  At the time of this report, the scanners project was pending the Panamanian government’s choice of a company to implement the project using bilateral funds.  The lack of scanners significantly limits the government’s ability to analyze cargo transiting the country, including at Tocumen International Airport, which has the highest number of passenger movements in the region, and entry and exit of the Colon Free Trade Zone.Panama continued to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement on ongoing counterterrorism cases in 2019, including individuals linked to Hizballah.  However, the Panamanian government’s ability to investigate financial support to terrorist-related organizations remained limited.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Panama is a member of GAFILAT.  Its FIU, the Financial Analysis Unit Panama (UAF-Panama), is a member of the Egmont Group.  UAF-Panama and one of its departments covers CFT-related reviews of information and prevention efforts related to countering the financing of terrorism.In June 2019, the FATF added Panama to its grey list of jurisdictions subject to ongoing monitoring due to strategic deficiencies and a lack of progress in the effectiveness of its AML/CFT regime.  FATF specifically noted that Panama must update the terrorism finance section of its National Risk Assessment and ensure that its findings inform national CFT policies and result in corresponding changes in activities of relevant competent authorities.  Panama agreed to an Action Plan with concrete measures to be completed in stages by May 2020 and September 2020.With support from the World Bank, Panama updated Chapter 5 of its National Risk Assessment, which relates to terrorism financing.  In February 2019, the Panama Maritime Authority, which oversees the world’s largest ship registry, de-flagged 59 Iranian vessels linked to sanctionable trade as outlined in UN resolutions and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Panama is an active participant in the United Nations and regional security initiatives such as the OAS Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (OAS-CICTE).  In October 2019, Panama hosted a CICTE workshop as part of CICTE’s “Technical Assistance for Implementation of Financial Sanctions against Terrorism” project.  The workshop focused on financial sanctions and domestic listings and included participation from 10 different Panamanian government institutions.In April 2019, Panama and Dominican Republic held a peer review exercise to analyze the implementation of UNSCR 1540 in both countries and to identify areas for regional collaboration and coordination.Separately, Panama steadily increased its cooperation with neighbors to better secure its borders against transnational criminal organizations (TCO).  During 2019, Panama signed information sharing agreements with Costa Rica and Colombia to enable further cooperation to combat TCO activity.  Panamanian security forces also conducted operations with Costa Rica and Colombia to identify TCO routes and networks.In 2019, the Government of Paraguay continued to be a receptive partner on counterterrorism cooperation with the United States.  Paraguay’s challenges stem from ineffective immigration, customs, financial, and law enforcement controls along its porous borders, particularly the Tri-Border Area (TBA) with Argentina and Brazil, and its dry border with Brazil from the TBA to Pedro Juan Caballero.Since 2008, persons claiming to be part of the Paraguayan People’s Army (EPP) – a domestic criminal group initially dedicated to a socialist revolution in Paraguay – have been involved in violence meant to extort and intimidate the population and local governments in the northern departments of Concepcion, San Pedro, and Amambay.  Paraguayan authorities officially consider the EPP and its offshoots – Mariscal Lopez’s Army (EML), and the Armed Peasant Association (ACA), which reemerged in May – as organized criminal groups rather than terrorist organizations.  However, public discourse of Paraguayan leaders occasionally refers to them informally as terrorist organizations.  The Government of Paraguay believes the EPP is a small, decentralized group of 20-50 members.  EPP, EML, and ACA’s activities have consisted largely of isolated attacks on remote police and army posts, or against ranchers and peasants accused of aiding Paraguayan security forces.  Ranchers and ranch workers in northeastern Paraguay, including members of the Mennonite community, claimed the EPP frequently threatened both their livelihoods and personal security.  As of December 1, authorities believe the EML held one hostage:  Felix Urbieta, who was kidnapped October 2016.  In April, the Paraguayan Internal Operational Defense Command (FTC) found an EPP pamphlet claiming that police officer Edelio Morinigo, who had been the longest-held victim, was deceased.  Although the FTC officially communicated the news to Morinigo’s family, the victim’s remains have not yet been found.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Alleged elements of the EPP and ACA continued to conduct killings and sabotage operations:On April 21, five ACA members held seven people hostage for less than two hours in Concepcion department.  They burned two pickup trucks, two tractors, and a horse cart.  Before fleeing, according to the victims, they railed against the production of genetically modified soybean and corn.On July 8, around 20 EPP members, including leader Osvaldo Daniel Villalba Ayala, held hostage 17 employees of a farm located in Amambay department.  The EPP group waited for the farm’s administrator to arrive and murdered him as soon as he stepped out of his car.  The majority of the EPP group allegedly included indigenous individuals from nearby areas.On October 18, a bomb located in the back of a pickup truck exploded as it was driving through a rural road in Concepcion department.  The driver and the other three accompanying persons were not harmed.  On November 15, ACA members claimed responsibility for the explosion.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The Paraguayan government continued to make use of a 2013 counterterrorism law that allows for the domestic deployment of the Paraguayan military to counter internal or external threats.  The FTC, the joint task force charged with countering the EPP, consists of around 800 military, supported by 471 Paraguayan National Police (PNP) officers, as well as National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) personnel.  The PNP Secretariat for the Prevention and Investigation of Terrorism officially handles CT functions, although other PNP units and agencies such as SENAD work such cases as well, particularly when related to drug trafficking.  In 2018, Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez inaugurated the new headquarters of the National Intelligence System (SINAI) service, composed of a National Intelligence Council (CNI) and a National Intelligence Secretariat (SNI), which report directly to the President.  The purpose of the SINAI is “detecting, neutralizing and counterbalancing the actions of domestic and international terrorist groups, and of transnational criminal organizations.”  The first meeting of the CNI took place on November 26, on the one-year anniversary of SNI’s formation.  Military forces and police officials continued to operate jointly in the San Pedro, Concepcion, and Amambay departments against the EPP, with limited success.On August 9, President Abdo Benitez signed decree 2307, designating Hizballah, Hamas, al-Qa’ida, and ISIS as terrorist organizations.  On October 23, Congress passed legislation allowing the Paraguayan government to freeze assets linked to terrorism and its financing, which the president signed into law November 18.On June 12, a court sentenced imprisoned EPP leader Alcides Oviedo Britez to 40 years in prison for masterminding the kidnapping of teenager Arlan Fick.  On September 26, a court sentenced Reinaldo Zeballos and Santiago Mercado Sosa to 13 years in prison for “terrorist association” for providing logistical support to the EPP.  On October 3, a court sentenced Maria Gloria Gonzalez, mother of EPP member Domingo Ovelar Gonzalez, to six years in prison for “terrorist association” for providing logistical support to the EPP.The TBA has been attractive to individuals engaged in terrorist financing as the limited military, customs, and migration agency presence along these borders allows for a largely unregulated flow of people, goods, and money.  Paraguay made strong efforts to provide more effective law enforcement and border security in 2019, but these efforts were hampered by a lack of interagency cooperation and information sharing, as well as corruption within security, border control, and judicial institutions.Following the 2017 establishment of Paraguay’s Seized and Forfeited Asset Management Secretariat (SENABICO), more than $165 million in seized goods are now under SENABICO administration.  SENABICO is charged with administering confiscated property and assets associated with criminal activity, including terrorism financing.  However, interagency disputes and a lack of understanding of advance sale legislation have prevented SENABICO from auctioning any of the assets under its administration.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Paraguay is a member of the GAFILAT.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit-Paraguay (UAF-SEPRELAD), is a member of the Egmont Group.  In 2019, Paraguay continued its work for the GAFILAT mutual evaluation, which started November 18.  On December 26, 2019, the Paraguayan Senate had passed the last of a packet of 12 draft laws that would tighten counterterrorism finance enforcement.Countering Violent Extremism:  Paraguay had no CVE program in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  Paraguay continued to support counterterrorism efforts in regional and multilateral organizations.  Paraguay actively participated in the Second Hemispheric Ministerial Conference against Terrorism meeting held in Argentina in July.   Paraguay is a member of the RSM and hosted the RSM’s first technical meeting in November.Paraguay participated in the OAS and its Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism.  It continued to collaborate with Argentina and Brazil on border security initiatives, regional exchanges, and law enforcement projects.  Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay coordinated law enforcement efforts in the TBA via their Trilateral Tri-Border Area Command.Peru successfully hosted the Pan American and Parapan American Games in 2019, with 8,500 athletes competing over 38 days across 20 venues – unprecedented in scale and duration.  The U.S. government coordinated with Peruvian security services to provide security support to U.S. athletes, teams, and attendees.  Peru’s execution of its comprehensive security plan for the Games enabled effective responses to several emerging threat streams, including arresting an alleged ISIS sympathizer.On January 17, Peru began retrying on terrorism charges Muhammad Ghaleb Hamdar, a Lebanese citizen suspected of links to Hizballah currently serving a sentence on document fraud.  If convicted, Hamdar would represent the first terrorism conviction of a Hizballah operative in South America.President Martín Vizcarra reaffirmed Peru’s commitment to restore law and order in the Valleys of the Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM) by its national bicentennial in 2021.  On November 1, despite protests and violence from coca farmers, Peru initiated coca eradication in the VRAEM for the first time.Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso or SL) continued to operate in the VRAEM.  Estimates vary, but most experts and Peruvian security services assess SL numbers between 250 and 300 members, including 60-150 armed fighters.  SL collects “revolutionary taxes” from those involved in the drug trade and, for a price, provides security and transportation services for drug trafficking organizations to support its terrorist activities.Víctor Quispe Palomino (aka Comrade José), a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency Most Wanted Fugitive, continued to lead the SL’s VRAEM’s remnants, which he calls the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP).  The son of an SL founder, Quispe Palomino allegedly oversees all MPCP illicit activities, including extortion, murder, and drug trafficking.  A U.S. Department of State reward offers up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction and the U.S. Department of Defense offers an additional $1 million for information leading to his capture.SL founder Abimael Guzmán and key accomplices are serving life sentences for terrorism in the 1980s and 1990s.  Many former SL members and leaders have served 25 to 30-year sentences on terrorism charges and could be released in the coming months and years.  Guzmán and other captured SL figures from earlier years deny association with the SL’s VRAEM group.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  The overall number of terrorist attacks and deaths of security forces attributable to terrorism declined in 2019.  Four soldiers died in two terrorist incidents:On June 25, SL members killed three soldiers upon attacking a joint military-police patrol in the VRAEM town Vizcatán.On August 9, SL members killed one soldier and injured two others during a VRAEM patrol that resulted in the death of an SL operative in Ayacucho’s Huanta province.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Peru adopted multiple counterterrorism laws over the past 30 years.  CT measures have broad public support.  On October 19, Peru issued an executive decree with measures to neutralize domestic and transnational terrorist actions:  the National Multisectoral Policy to Combat Terrorism.Peru’s significant 2019 counterterrorism actions included:Security forces’ July 12 capture of SL military commander Julio Chapo, reportedly fifth in the SL military hierarchy and responsible for several killings and ambushes against security forces, in Huancavelica’s Churcampa province of the VRAEM.The July 17 arrest and preventive detention of Brian Eugenio Alvarado Huari in Lima for alleged links to ISIS and plans to “attack foreigners” during Peru’s 2019 Pan American Games.The July 29 capture of Serapio Cárdenas Villarroel (a.k.a. “Papicho”) in Ayacucho’s Huanta province in the VRAEM.  A veteran SL member since the 1980s, Cárdenas is allegedly responsible for killing at least four people, including two police officers.The August 9 killing of SL central committee member and firearms specialist Juan Carlos Badajoz Vizarres (a.k.a. “Miguel” or “Bomba”) during a joint patrol of the Peruvian National Police and Army in Huanta province.Immigration authorities collected limited biometrics information from visitors to protect Peruvian border security.  Peru implemented a new regulation June 15 allowing only Venezuelan citizens who hold passports and humanitarian visas to enter Peruvian territory.  Visas were not required for citizens of most countries from Europe, Southeast Asia, or Central America (except El Salvador and Nicaragua).The U.S.-Peru arrangement to exchange terrorist screening information became operational April 17, in time for Peru’s hosting of the Pan American Games and Parapan American Games.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Peru is a member of the GAFILAT.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit of Peru, is a member of the Egmont Group.  GAFILAT completed its mutual evaluation report of Peru in February 2019; the report contained several recommendations to enhance its AML/CFT regimes.  The superintendent of banking, insurance, and private administrators of pension funds improved efforts to regulate cooperatives, including enhanced measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.Countering Violent Extremism:  Peru promotes concrete measures to prevent and combat terrorism.  The government’s multi-sectoral VRAEM 2021 Development Strategy consolidates opportunities for sustainable social and economic development as part of its bicentennial vision.  Peru’s whole-of-government effort to foster alternative development and social inclusion in the VRAEM complements aggressive action against SL terrorism, propaganda, and recruitment.On November 26, Peru co-hosted with Belgium, Poland, and the UK the UN Security Council’s Arria-formula meeting on reintegrating former child combatants, reflecting Peru’s focus on the needs of children who are vulnerable to social stigmatization and re-recruitment following their rescue from SL.International and Regional Cooperation:  Peruvian officials participated in CT activities in international organizations, including the UN, the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism, the Union of South American Nations, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.  Peru chaired the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee for the second of a two-year term.   Peru sent a high-level delegation to the Second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial Conference in Argentina in July and offered to host a future ministerial conference.In November, the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate conducted an assessment in Peru to identify good practices, challenges, and areas in which Peru may require technical assistance or provide technical assistance to other member states.  Peru’s Counter-Terrorism Directorate, a Peruvian National Police branch, coordinated with police in other countries to track activities of domestic terrorist organizations abroad.The threat from ISIS sympathizers in Trinidad and Tobago and the possible return of persons who traveled, or attempted to travel, to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS are the primary terrorism threats in the country.Trinidad and Tobago and the United States continue to cooperate on CT investigations involving Trinidad and Tobago nationals.  In 2019, Trinidad and Tobago substantially completed an action plan to address deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2017.2019 Terrorist Incidents:  There were no terrorist incidents reported in Trinidad and Tobago.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Trinidad and Tobago’s counterterrorism institutions remain challenged by deficiencies in staffing, interagency coordination, and funding.  There are ongoing efforts to break down existing silos within the government, but distrust continues to impede coordination.  Though no significant terrorism-related prosecutions have been initiated, a lengthy judicial process can mean years before criminal prosecutions, including any related to terrorism, are or would be resolved.Trinidad and Tobago has not changed its Anti-Terrorism Act since 2018.  A 2019 amendment to the country’s general law governing the availability of bail for criminal defendants now prohibits bail for anyone charged with certain offenses under the Anti-Terrorism Act that carry a jail sentence of 10 years or more.The government’s efforts to strengthen criminal justice institutions in 2019 included updated plea-bargaining and bail provisions and the introduction of judge-only trials, new courts, and improved technology to speed the disposition of criminal cases.  The government also introduced draft legislation to enable new procedures for law enforcement officers and witnesses to identify suspects in criminal proceedings, to require audio or video recordings of suspect interviews, and to protect witnesses and victims testifying in court.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continued preparation of an operational plan to implement a national counterterrorism strategy adopted in 2018.  An interagency government task force created in 2018 to develop policies related to the possible return and reintegration of FTFs and other persons who traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS continued its work in 2019.Trinidad and Tobago institutions have demonstrated the capability to detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism with the assistance of international partners.  The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS), including its Special Branch, Special Investigations Unit, and Financial Investigations Branch, is the law enforcement agency with primary responsibility for investigating terrorism and terrorism finance cases.  Trinidad and Tobago’s Strategic Services Agency, Defense Force, Prison Service, Immigration Division, Customs and Excise Division, and the Financial Intelligence Unit support the TTPS’ activities.  The TTPS has conducted vulnerability risk assessments of soft targets and national critical infrastructure.Trinidad and Tobago continues to collect and analyze API and requires commercial air carriers to transmit information on all passengers and crew members on inbound flights and certain outbound flights to the Joint Regional Communications Center operated by the Caribbean Community’s (CARICOM) Implementation Agency for Crime and Security.  According to the Trinidad and Tobago government, it also maintains a national watchlist of persons of interest to national security, which can include persons suspected of engaging in terrorist activity.  The Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard increased patrols of its southern maritime border, which is less than 10 miles from the coast of Venezuela.The Trinidad and Tobago Prison Service created a high-risk management unit in 2018 that was designated in 2019 as the primary unit responsible for dealing with any FTFs should they be incarcerated upon their return.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Trinidad and Tobago is a member of CFATF.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit of Trinidad and Tobago, is a member of the Egmont Group.In October, the FATF made an initial determination that Trinidad and Tobago has substantially completed its action plan to address identified strategic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering AML/CFT regimes, subject to verification that implementation of these reforms has been sustained.Trinidad and Tobago passed legislation in 2019 requiring non-profit organizations (NPOs) to register with the government and subjecting these organizations to oversight by the FIU.  The government also carried out a risk assessment of NPOs, including with respect to terrorism finance.  Several government agencies conducted outreach and issued guidance in 2019 to regulated entities on their obligations regarding terrorism finance and persons sanctioned under the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act.  Trinidad and Tobago also passed legislation to allow for civil asset recovery and “unexplained wealth” orders, though a new agency must first be created before civil asset recovery is fully operational.  The country also passed amendments to its Companies Act to compel more adequate and accurate beneficial ownership information.Trinidad and Tobago continued in 2019 to list individuals and organizations domestically that have been designated under relevant UN terrorism-related sanctions regimes using the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act.  There have been no persons charged or prosecuted for terrorism financing to date, nor has the government identified and frozen the assets of any persons designated under either UN sanctions regimes or domestically.  The Ministry of the Attorney General and Legal Affairs established an Anti-Terrorism Unit to manage designations and other functions of the Attorney General’s Office pursuant to the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act.Countering Violent Extremism:  The Trinidad and Tobago government completed the final draft of a national “Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism” plan; final government approval of the plan remains pending.Trinidad and Tobago’s National Crime Prevention Program continued its outreach to vulnerable communities in the country, and the TTPS increased its engagement with youth in high-risk areas through its use of youth clubs, sporting events, and partnerships with local NGOs.In June, Trinidad and Tobago government representatives presented at a conference with leaders of the country’s private sector as part of an effort to systematize funding for civil society organizations working on CVE issues.  The Trinidad and Tobago government also spoke at and participated in a workshop in November with representatives from the country’s Muslim community to encourage collaboration on a rehabilitation and reintegration plan for possible returning ISIS-affiliated Trinbagonian nationals.International and Regional Cooperation:  Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism.  Trinidad and Tobago is also a member of CARICOM and is working with other CARICOM member states to implement a regional CT strategy adopted in 2018.Trinidad and Tobago has partnered with Hedayah, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and the UK Commonwealth Secretariat, among others, to develop its national CVE plan.  The UN is assisting the government’s inter-ministerial committee to implement Trinidad and Tobago’s national counterterrorism strategy; in September, the UN and Trinidad and Tobago announced the country will host a regional CT conference in 2020.  The International Institute of Justice and Rule of Law has provided training to law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and others on developing terrorism-related cases.The city of Chaguanas in Trinidad is a member of the SCN.On January 10, 2019, Nicolás Maduro sought to begin an illegitimate second term as president, following 2018 presidential elections that were widely condemned as fraudulent.  Juan Guaidó, as president of the National Assembly (AN), invoked the Venezuelan constitution on January 23 concerning vacancies in the Office of the President to assume the role of Interim President.  Maduro and his associates use criminal activities to help maintain their illegitimate hold on power, fostering a permissive environment for known terrorist groups, including dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-D), the Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN), and Hizballah sympathizers.  Financial ties with FARC-D, ELN, and Venezuelan paramilitary groups facilitate the public corruption and graft schemes of the regime to include members of the armed forces.  Of concern, there were reports noting sporadic cooperation between FARC-D and ELN in the areas of road/border checkpoints, subsidized food distribution, recruitment and forced displacement of vulnerable indigenous communities, and trafficking of illegal narcotics and gold.  According to local and international media, ELN was present in 12 of Venezuela’s 24 states (with particular strength in Anzoátegui, Amazonas, Apure, Bolivar, Zulia, and Táchira states).  The ELN’s presence has expanded beyond its historic base in the border zone with Colombia.  Media report an increasing role for the ELN in regime-subsidized food distribution, contraband (gas, basic goods, meat), extortion, illegal mining, and recruitment propaganda, at times via control of radio stations.Interim President Guaidó condemned Maduro’s complicity with the ELN and FARC-D.  In October, he said that the former regime “promotes and protects terrorism, representing a risk for peace in the region.”  Within the same resolution, the AN officially designated the FARC-D, ELN, Hamas, Hizballah, and ISIS as terrorist organizations.  Guaidó warned that Maduro has lost control of Venezuela’s borders and territory, running the risk of turning Venezuela into a “failed state.”2019 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist incidents in Venezuela reflected ELN’s growing presence and territorial control. There were increased confrontations between ELN, other Colombian and Venezuelan illegal armed groups, and Venezuelan government forces.Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  There were no changes to Venezuela’s counterterrorism legislation in 2019.The former Maduro regime has not demonstrated political will to address terrorism concerns in Venezuela.  The regime’s usurpation of the judicial system and military/security services for its own illicit ends, rampant public corruption, and cooperation with criminal elements provided ideal conditions for illegal activity.  The regime’s economic mismanagement has created dire resource constraints.  The regime regularly uses charges of terrorism to persecute the political opposition and suppress dissent.  It has accused without evidence or due process Guaidó’s Chief of Staff and multiple AN deputies of “terrorism.”Systematic corruption plagues the issuance of Venezuelan passport and identification documents.  In December 2019, the United States sanctioned the current and former directors of Venezuela’s passport agency (Administrative Service of Identification, Migration, and Immigration) in light of activities such as the agency’s sales of passports for thousands of dollars, including to non-Venezuelan citizens.  Border security at ports of entry was vulnerable and susceptible to corruption.  Biometric screening is not conducted at Venezuelan ports of entry.  There is no automated system to collect API or PNR records on commercial flights or to crosscheck flight manifests with passenger disembarkation data.Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Venezuela is a member of the CFATF.  Venezuela’s FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no significant updates in 2019.Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no CVE efforts underway in 2019.International and Regional Cooperation:  The Guaidó government worked with regional partners to invoke the Interamerican Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (also known as the Rio Treaty) in September to address the former Maduro regime’s illegal activities, including terrorism and its financing.  Guaidó pledged to work closely with Colombian President Duque on the regional threat posed by ELN, FARC-D, and other illegal armed actors in Venezuela.')"

    "complete_ST_text = ('To designate a country as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, the Secretary of State must determine that the government of such country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.  Once a country is designated, it remains a State Sponsor of Terrorism until the designation is rescinded in accordance with statutory criteria.  A wide range of sanctions is imposed as a result of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation, including:A ban on arms-related exports and sales;Controls over exports of dual-use items, requiring 30-day Congressional notification for goods or services that could significantly enhance the terrorist-list country’s military capability or ability to support terrorism;Prohibitions on economic assistance; andImposition of miscellaneous financial and other restrictions.On November 20, 2017, the Secretary of State designated the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  The Secretary determined that the DPRK government repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as the DPRK was implicated in assassinations on foreign soil.The DPRK was previously designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1988 primarily because of its involvement in the bombing of a Korean Airlines passenger flight in 1987.  The DPRK’s designation was rescinded in 2008 after a thorough review found the DPRK met the statutory requirements for rescission.  In 2017, the Secretary of State determined the DPRK had repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism since its State Sponsor of Terrorism designation was rescinded in 2008.  The DPRK has also failed to take action to address historical support for acts of international terrorism.  Four Japanese Red Army members wanted by the Japanese government for participating in a 1970 Japan Airlines hijacking continue to shelter in the DPRK.  The Japanese government also continues to seek a full accounting of the fate of a number of Japanese nationals believed to have been abducted by DPRK state entities in the 1970s and 1980s; only five such abductees have been repatriated to Japan since 2002.Designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984, Iran continued its terrorist-related activity in 2019, including support for Hizballah, Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, and various terrorist groups in Syria, Iraq, and throughout the Middle East.  Iran used the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to provide support to terrorist organizations, provide cover for associated covert operations, and create instability in the region.  Iran has acknowledged the involvement of the IRGC-QF in the Iraq and Syria conflicts, and the IRGC-QF is Iran’s primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad.  In April 2019, the Secretary of State designated the IRGC, including the Qods Force, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO).  Iran also used regional proxy forces to provide deniability, in an attempt to shield it from accountability for its aggressive policies.In 2019, Iran supported various Iraqi Shia terrorist groups, including Kata’ib Hizballah (KH), Harakat al-Nujaba, and Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq.  During the same period, KH was responsible for a series of rocket attacks against American interests in Iraq, which culminated in the death of an American citizen following a 30 plus rocket barrage in December 2019.  On December 31, Iran‑backed Shia militia groups, including KH, participated in an attack on U.S. Embassy Baghdad, which resulted in significant damage to embassy property.  There were no embassy casualties and security personnel used less-than-lethal countermeasures to repulse intruders. It also bolstered the Assad regime in Syria and Shia terrorist groups operating there, including Hizballah.  Iran views the Assad regime in Syria as a crucial ally and Syria and Iraq as vital routes through which to supply weapons to Hizballah, Iran’s primary terrorist proxy group.  Through financial or residency enticements, Iran has facilitated and coerced primarily Shia fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan to participate in the Assad regime’s brutal crackdown in Syria.  Iran-supported Shia militias in Iraq have also committed serious human rights abuses against primarily Sunni civilians.  Iranian forces have directly backed militia operations in Syria with armored vehicles, artillery, and drones.Since the end of the 2006 Israeli-Hizballah conflict, Iran has supplied Hizballah with thousands of rockets, missiles, and small arms in direct violation of UNSCR 1701.  Israeli security officials and politicians expressed concerns that Iran was supplying Hizballah with advanced weapons systems and technologies, as well as assisting the group in creating infrastructure that would permit it to indigenously produce rockets and missiles to threaten Israel from Lebanon and Syria.  Iran has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Hizballah and trained thousands of its fighters at camps in Iran.  Hizballah fighters have been used extensively in Syria to support the Assad regime.  In Bahrain, Iran has continued to provide weapons, support, and training to local Shia militant groups, including the al-Ashtar Brigades.  In Yemen, Iran has provided weapons, support, and training to the Houthi militants, who have engaged in terrorist attacks against regional targets.In 2019, Iran provided support to Hamas and other designated Palestinian terrorist groups, including Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.  These Palestinian terrorist groups were behind numerous deadly attacks originating in Gaza and the West Bank, including attacks against Israeli civilians in the Sinai Peninsula.The Iranian government maintains a robust offensive cyber program and has sponsored cyber attacks against foreign government and private sector entities.Iran remained unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qa’ida (AQ) members residing in the country and has refused to publicly identify members in its custody.  Iran has allowed AQ facilitators to operate a core facilitation pipeline through Iran since at least 2009, enabling AQ to move funds and fighters to South Asia and Syria.As in past years, the Iranian government continued supporting terrorist plots to attack Iranian dissidents in several countries in continental Europe.  In recent years, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Albania have all either arrested or expelled Iranian government officials implicated in various terrorist plots in their respective territories.  Denmark similarly recalled its ambassador from Tehran after learning of an Iran-backed plot to assassinate an Iranian dissident in its country.The Secretary of State designated Sudan as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1993 for supporting international terrorist groups, including the Abu Nidal Organization, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hizballah.  In September 2019, Sudan officially formed the civilian-led transitional government (CLTG) after 30 years under the regime of former President Omar al-Bashir. The CLTG has asserted that it no longer supports the aforementioned or any other terrorist organization.  Sudan has taken steps to work with the United States on counterterrorism.  Throughout 2019, despite political turmoil that led to the ouster of the former president and the formation in September of the CLTG, the Sudanese government continued to pursue counterterrorism operations alongside regional partners, including operations to counter threats to U.S. interests and personnel in Sudan.Despite the absence of high-profile terrorist attacks, ISIS facilitation networks appear to be active within Sudan.  The newly appointed Minister of Religious Affairs and Endowments under the CLTG denied the existence of an official ISIS entity in Sudan but acknowledged that there were “extremists” linked to ISIS in the country.  The Minister of Religious Affairs and Endowments also emphasized that his ministry would work on combating extremism, fighting terrorism and renewing school curricula to promote tolerance.  The media reported in November 2019 that the CLTG was prepared to return between 16 and 20 terrorists from ISIS and other groups to their countries of origin.  The arrested persons belonged to different nationalities, including six Egyptians, one Tunisian, and six individuals from Chad and Nigeria.As part of the government’s counterterrorism strategy, Sudanese forces patrol the Sudanese‑Libyan border as well as the Sudanese-Chadian border to interdict the flow of suspected terrorists transiting through the region, and to prevent arms smuggling and other illicit activities. Sudan’s expansive size, and the government’s outdated technology and limited visa restrictions, presented challenges for border security.  The CLTG has asked for assistance from the U.S. government as well as the international community to upgrade its technical and physical capabilities to secure its borders.Regarding AML/CFT, Sudan remains a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF), a Financial Action Task Force-style regional body.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and MENAFATF have both determined that Sudan’s AML/CFT regime adequately addresses AML/CFT.  Additionally, Sudan’s Financial Information Unit is a member of the Egmont Group and works regularly with other members of the group on AML/CFT issues.While new, the CLTG continues to develop a national strategy for countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment.  Sudan’s existing strategy combines government and civil society resources and uses a social, economic, and religious approach toward strengthening Sudan’s population against internal or external “extremist” influences.  Sudan’s de-radicalization programs run concurrently with the national strategy.  De-radicalization programs in Sudan focused on reintegrating and rehabilitating returned FTFs and those espousing terrorist ideologies.  Sudan repatriated a small number of women and children who are or had been affiliated with FTFs, mostly the spouses and children of ISIS members killed in Libya, and enrolled them in Sudanese rehabilitation programs.Designated in 1979 as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, Syria continued its political and military support to various terrorist groups.  The regime continued to provide weapons and political support to Hizballah and continued to allow Iran to rearm and finance the terrorist organization. The Assad regime’s relationship with Hizballah and Iran grew stronger in 2019 as the regime became more reliant on external actors to fight opponents and secure areas.  The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) remains present and active in the country with the permission of President Bashar al-Assad.  Assad remained a staunch defender of Iran’s policies, while Iran exhibited equally energetic support for the Syrian regime. Syrian government speeches and press releases often included statements supporting terrorist groups, particularly Hizballah and vice versa.Over the past two decades, the Assad regime’s permissive attitude towards AQ and other terrorist groups’ FTF facilitation efforts during the Iraq conflict fed the growth of AQ, ISIS, and affiliated terrorist networks inside Syria.  The Syrian government’s awareness and encouragement for many years of terrorists’ transit through Syria to Iraq for the purpose of fighting U.S. forces before 2012 is well documented.  Those very networks were among the terrorist elements that brutalized the Syrian and Iraqi populations in 2019.  Additionally, Shia militia groups in Iraq, some of which are U.S.-designated FTOs aligned with Iran, continued to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of the Assad regime.  Marxist groups, including affiliates of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), also operated on Syrian soil and represent Turkey’s primary counterterrorism concern in Syria.  ISIS cells remained active in parts of Syria and launched attacks on civilians and U.S. partner forces.  In October, U.S. forces completed an operation that resulted in the death of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi.  ISIS members in Syria continued to plot or inspire external terrorist operations.As part of a broader strategy during the year, the regime portrayed Syria itself as a victim of terrorism, characterizing all internal armed opposition as “terrorists.”')"
